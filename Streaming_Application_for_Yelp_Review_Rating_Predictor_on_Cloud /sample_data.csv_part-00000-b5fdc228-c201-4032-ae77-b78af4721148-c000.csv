As my sister and I wearily left the doctor's office today, prescriptions in hand and noses red as Rudolph... We wanted some hearty congee (the Chinese equivalent cold and flu remedy of the West's Chicken Noodle Soup).  Using my western thinking cap about how chicken is effective when you're sick we opted for 2 bowls of chicken and fish congee... Clocking in at $7 an order, it wasn't cheap... But be it my yen for over-MSG-ed food (as my taste buds were shot) or my need for a cold-comforting bowl of congee... Keung's always satisfies my taste buds.

Homemade congee just doesn't measure up in terms of taste to store-bought congee... Perhaps its the MSG that makes it so addictive? Oh well...",1,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg

The serving sizes are not large but the flavor is amazing and it's hard to beat.  I think this place has the best rotisserie chicken in Charlotte.

The location can be somewhat tricky to find.  Pio Pio is in the southeast corner of East and Scott.  It's in that shopping plaza and it's in the corner.  The last time I was there, Pio Pio did not have a real sign outside yet.",1,DQIt5Uv87fdS54b2oTXBMQ

The only reason why I give it 3 stars is because the chicken ( their main dish) wasn't as yummy as I expected it, well seasoned around but a little dry.
The rest of the food we ordered was really good and well portioned, their Sangria is pretty good, I would go back definitely, I recommend it give it a try if you are in the area.

--cZ6Hhc9F7VkKXxHMVZSQ,0,2012-11-13 00:07:23,0,Vop2JETYFrnO0mUy3aGy_w,5.0,"Living in Huntersville we don't venture down into Charlotte all too often, with plenty of good eats close to home. But word on the street was that Pio Pio was the place to pack in the poultry, and when a Groupon-esque deal came my way I just had to take advantage and see what the cluck everyone was talking about.

Pio Pio is hidden within a strip mall area, and not exactly the most likely place to find good eats. Don't let the location fool you...they are serving up fantastic food in that place! I like rotisserie chicken, be it from home, from Harris Teeter...heck, I'll even praise Boston Market! Yet the chicken at Pio Pio beats them all. We each got a 1/4 chicken combo and it was some of the best chicken I've ever had out. The chicken is succulent, moist, juicy, tender...basically cooked to perfection. The skin was an excellent, sinful indulgence that was too good to pass up. A combination of cooking technique and spices made this meal as good as it was. Here's a hint: let your server know if you prefer light or dark. Our server didn't ask and ended up placing a plate of dark meat in front of me and white meat in front of the miss'. Neither of us complained since that is what we would have ordered regardless, but I found it odd that they give different types of meat to customers without asking for preferences. 

Not only is the chicken great but the sides were pretty banging too. Ever since moving to the area I've been relatively disappointed with the rice and beans at most of the Mexican restaurants. I was shocked to find that best I've had wasn't at a typical Mexican joint but at Pio Pio. The rice is cooked PERFECTLY, with the right flavor and, more importantly (to me), the right texture. The beans are not refried mush, but actual beans in a gravy. A helpful hint is to pour those bad boys right into the rice, and you have yourself one heck of a side dish. 

The combo meal came with the chicken, rice, beans, and a choice of side. I chose to go with the yucca since I've never had it before, and I was glad I took the adventurous road. They fry the yucca like a french fry, but it's a thick brick instead of a little shoestring. The taste and texture is similar to a fry, but there's more substance to it, making it more filling. The miss' went with the plantains and they were down right tastetacular. Hot, sweet, carmelized plantains don't get much better than this. While I did enjoy the yucca, I would say the plantains are the way to go.

The chicken portion is slightly skimpy, but they fill you up with heaping helpings of sides. If you are a  connoisseur  of the poultry arts I highly recommend checking this place out. Great food and definitely worth the price!",0,46HhzhpBfTdTSB5ceTx_Og

It is a little bit hidden back in a strip mall which sounds bad but it's a nice strip mall...I mean c'mon it's Dilworth after all.  After you find it, parking is a breeze.

We almost exclusively go for the rotisserie chicken and saffron rice.  You absolutely can't go wrong with those.  From there we tend to mix it up each time and maybe do some soup or fried yuca or something like that.  Portions are pretty big...we almost always have a to go box.  And come to think of it I don't believe we have ever had dessert there.  But I'm sure if we did we would like it as well.  We can usually get out of there for $25-$30 for 2 people which is pretty good for us.

I also found the chicken, and rice and beans to be very flavorful.  Unfortunately, I would have to give the service a C-, at best.  Initially seated near the door, I asked for a table change to avoid the cold draft.  The server responded with a rude, \"No!\".  Thankfully, another server accomodated the request.  No one asked if we needed refills on our drinks (we did).  When we were finally given our bill, we gave the server the coupon (which we told them we had upon being seated).  We waited and waited for the revised bill reflecting the discount.  The server finally returned to the table and said that if we weren't going to order anything else he would have to charge us for sitting at the table because the table was needed for other customers. (And no, he wasn't joking.) Excuse me???  We're waiting to pay YOU and you are going to charge us for \"table time\"?  They seemed to be certainly overwhelmed by the crowd---but, on a Friday evening what were they expecting?

All said, because the food was good, and the reviews have been consistently favorable, I am going to give this place a second chance.  I just will make sure to avoid them during peak times (no Friday or Saturday evening or lunch time!).",0,fcVzVFg07-SpMz_vfBy4qQ

Everything is clean & neat with a nice, warm decor.  The music was a bit loud for a small space, but not overwhelming.  The waitress was pleasant enough & brought our food quickly.

They have outdoor seating on the sidewalk...this is a strip mall place, but there are bushes & trees, so it's nice.

I had the rotisserie chicken salad w/fries $9.75 and my sweetie had the 1/2 chicken w/rice $11.75 so I think the pricing is high for what you get.   I probably wouldn't be back just because of the cost.",1,ciXjBfJrAEteIKpzZg4I9g

The restaurant had a few other tables full when we arrived, a mix of couples, families, people dropping by for take out, and a Bring Me That delivery employee waiting for a delivery order. I ordered the 1/4 chicken white meat meal with rice, beans, and plantains. My husband got the 1/4 dark with yucca. Everything was great! The chicken was super flavorful, even bites without skin tasted like the marinade/seasonings they use. The rice, as many other reviewers have mentioned, is delicious - the saffron flavor is definitely noticeable, but not overpowering (I love saffron, so I was not surprised that the rice was one of my favorite parts of the meal -  a close second to the chicken.)

Instead of ordering the things that received the best reviews, like the meat platters and heavier South American dishes, my wife and I opted for the ceviches since the weather was very warm.  Our mistake was not understanding that Columbian ceviche comes swimming in an approximation of thousand island dressing and not simply in the usual citrus juice and herbs.

I thus have high standards for Peruvian and went into this Pio Pio with high expectations.  Nonetheless it was good enough for me to give it 3 stars, My friends who did not have a point of reference for this food liked it much more than i did and gave it 4 stars. 
The arepa was made of white corn,  I found it to be a little tasteless aside from the cheese. The roasted chicken was good and I got it with fried yuca. What really turned me off was their Lomo Saltado. In the many places that I've had this dish before, the fries are sauteed in with the meat, but here they were served on the side. I find the quirkiness of the fries in the in the meat to be what makes the dish so alluring and unique, so taking that away took a lot for me.

The staff is very friendly. I had the \"Montanero\", which is the name that they gave their \"Bandeja Paisa\". Everything was great with the exception of the steak. And my only complaint about the steak is that it wasnt churrasco (skirt steak), which is the cut im used to having. My girlfriend had the Lomo Saltado. Everything about the dish tasted great but it definitely was not your traditional Lomo Saltado. This is a very good spot for anybody who grew up around Latin culture and eating Latin food.

So we had a few other dishes and shared a lot. The service was attentive, prompt, and friendly. The atmosphere is basic. On to the food reviews:
* Green and white table sauces: The green has a nice kick to it. The white is somewhat tangier. You could mix them together or enjoy them each separately. They're darn good, but I wouldn't say you would drink them by the ounce (i.e. they seemed to be slightly overhyped based on what I was told by my friend).
* Arepa: 3.5 stars. Pretty standard, average stuff. No seared flavor, it is merely a vessel.
* Tostones: 3.5 stars. Same as above. They lose heat quickly and end up a bit hard.
* Sweet plantains: 5 stars. They have a delicious sugary burnt crisp to the edge, unlike most places where they end up mushy. Definitely order this as one of your sides.
* Rice: 4 stars. It's rice. It's nice rice.
* Pork skin: 4+ stars. Nothing outstanding, but it's done right. Maybe a little on the smallish side. Pork skins are always at least 4 stars when done right.
* Chicken soup: 4.5 stars. You may want to add salt, but be sure not to overwhelm the subtle spices that lend the broth an extraordinary flavor. I did find it slightly bland, but I'm not deducting any stars for a restaurant that chooses to let you salt to taste instead of deciding how much sodium you need.
* Side salad: *shrug* It's a salad. It's got decent size to it, but it is what it is.

This is not my first time here but I have been cheating on them with another Peruvian chicken restaurant. Tonight I decided to grab a dinner for my family cause I trust the quality and taste of their food and I knew one of the combos would satisfy my whole family. Plus they are open til 10pm which allows me to go after work at 9pm. 

From order to pick up I would say 15 minutes elapsed. I was a little annoyed when I arrived and saw the posted extra sauce charge. How am I suppose to know how much sauce I need?? My family loves condiments ... how many extras will I need for everyone. I decided on an extra 2 of each sauce. Adding another dollar to my bill. 

Overall I was satisfied with what I ordered. The food was tasty and the portions were good. 

I'm not sure if this is going to go back to my regular Peruvian Chicken spot of choice but here are a few pros and cons for this establishment. 

PRO:
*open til 10pm
*large portions
*simple menu

CONS:
*extra sauce charge
*doesn't work well with larger groups",3,12iozmUYN_gvAng9kMLs_w

My husband and I decided to eat in last week and our meal was the usual- decent food that made a quick weekday dinner, loud but peppy music, decent service! I signed the receipt and remember I signed it off as an even $30 (including tip). While reviewing my a/c statement yesterday I noticed I was charged 31.52. This made no sense to me and I was quite honestly surprised. Wanting to let them  know (of human error, ignorance or foul play) I called the restaurant and asked to speak with the manager. I was told he wasn't available. I told the woman on the phone (who was really sweet and appreciative of my call) what had happened and left a message for the Manager to call me back. It's been over 24 hours and I haven't received a call yet. 
Long story short- I feel cheated. A dollar fifty doesn't matter, it's about honesty and integrity. Signed receipts being manipulated (erroneously or on purpose) is appalling and I'm sure illegal.

They have affordable wine and sangria, and it is not loud at all, so it's the perfect place for a casual dinner with friends.

And the food is amazing. If you've never been you definitely need to get the chicken on your first trip. The rice and beans are so good (some restaurants just mail those traditional sides in) and they are seasoned well with saffron (rice) and whatever is in the beans I just want to drink up. The ripe plantains and tostones are excellent as well. And the chicken is deliciously roasted and the skin is nice and crispy. The side sauces they bring To the table with your meal are the perfect accompniant: ones has a slow burn spiciness and the other is mild for those who don't like spicy (as a tip, they make great dipping sauces for your plantains and tostones).

On my most recent visit we went for lunch, so unfortunately no wine or sangria was involved. I ordered the salad for a bit lighter option, with a side of tostones (obvi). The salad was fresh and delicious and I basically hit the avocado jackpot (I think there was a whole sliced avocado on my salad). My salad was made complete with a generous helping of shredded chicken on top. The tostones were crispy and satisfying.

I'm SO glad we stopped when we did. 
We decided to sit outside and ordered a whole chicken ( not knowing how huge the portion was going to be) for 9 bucks! A whole chicken= $9 i mean c'mon that's a freakin steal.

Sweet plaintains; well they're plantians no matter how you slice em. Fried yucca was just that, yummy in my tummy fried yucca. Rice and beans were solid but what Pio Pio does best are the dipping sauces. 

I don't know how to describe them but I'm guessing one is a vinegar based garlic cream sauce and the second I can't even put my finger on.

The place is inmate and cozy with one small television. I have been multiple times and it has been awhile since I been back though . I can say they have consistently good tasting food. 

If you don't like flavorful food turn around and stop reading this now and choose another place. The food has intense flavors and it taste like it was cooked in someone kitchen like a street food feel but in a restaurant . 

The rice is so good I could eat that with every meal from now on. I have tried a couple things but I recommend the chicken ! 1/4  is a good size but if you are really hungry go for the 1/2 size !

At first I thought that it was because the restaurant was super popular, but I quickly found out the reason why it was packed. The food takes forever. It took around 30 minutes just for one of the three appetizers we ordered to arrive. The restaurant also does not serve all the appetizers first before the mains. Instead, they served 1 main with the appetizers, forcing the rest of the table to wait. 2 of the mains came after 40 minutes of waiting. When I asked the waitress if she could follow up on our mains, she simply responding \"the kitchen is making it right now\". What kind of attitude is this? Not only did she not apologize, she made it seem that it was rude for me to ask.

The service is terrible- zero sense of customer service. I asked for a water refill and the waitress only filled my cup. I am absolutely astounded that this restaurant still operates. I will never return to this location and strongly do not recommend this restaurant.",1,gSCS2S9RParSbXGXmPnVfQ

It's not the roomiest of restaurants, but they do pretty well arranging the tables and space. Decor is pretty simple, with a clean look.

FOOD:

I ordered the \"Scallops with Truffle Cream Sauce\" sizzling plate based off of foodie extraordinaire Cherrie T's recommendation, and it was in fact quite good. The scallops were fairly big, and I could actually taste the truffle in the creamy sauce. More than enough noodles as well.

The \"Okonomiyaki Fries\" stole the show for me. Like the \"Shake Shake Fries,\" these fries were nice and crispy, and well seasoned. The sizzling plate it came on kept it warm, though it wasn't needed given how fast we scarfed it down!

SERVICE:

A bit on the slow side, as my dish did come much after everybody else at my table. I'll give them a pass though, given they were pretty busy that night. Didn't notice anything either way about the service, so it must have been good enough.

VERDICT:

I'll be back for the fries, and to tries the other sizzling plates.",3,aLvxbF2DueKFOqul9eVWCw

It has the look of a chain, with decor and menu boards that look institutional, but still seems like a single mom and pop operation.  I ordered a quick lunch, consisting of a traditional Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, fries and a drink.  

The meat on the sandwich was nothing impressive, fairly bland, a bit tough, and with a bit more fat and tough bits than the real deal I have had in Philadelphia. The onions and green peppers were undercooked, and the cheese did not seem to blend correctly.

Overall, it is not a bad lunch, but it didn't offer me any reason to return when there are so many other options.  Try it for yourself, just to be fair.

UPDATE:  I decided it was time to give it another try. I ordered the Big EZ. Overall, it's a pretty substantial sandwich for $10. Flavour was good, but still there is a gaggable chunk of gristle in every bite.

When I ordered the cheesesteak, they asked if I wanted Provolone on it, and I said I wanted cheese whiz on it.  They then asked if I was actually from Philly because they noticed most people that ordered it that way were actually from Philly.  Who knew =)  The sandwich is served in a hoagie bun.

I actually really liked the sandwich.  Aside from the bun (that kinda reminded me of a hotdog bun), I really liked the consistancy of the meat as well as the seasoning.  Not sure about other people's reviews on it (maybe it's hit and miss) but I really enjoyed mine.

First, we go to Vegas a few times a year but never with the kids, 13-12-16-17 yes I have! LOL Anyways.... I wanted a hotel that was off the strip and family friendly without a casino, kids have bad allergies and casinos are all bad for that. So I found a groupon for a 2 bedroom villa for $345 for 3 nights 4 days. I thought that was an awesome deal!

Arrived on Monday, early and requested to check in early, the gentleman at the counter was very nice and said that wasn't an issue and got us our room early. After check in your escorted to another counter (timeshare) there was a gentleman there asking us to go the presentation and I said no, if we did it would be on the last day and thats not likely. He didnt pressure us, said heres your free kids dinner and drink passes and we were on our way.

Upon checking into our room, 2232, 2nd floor room. It smelt like curry, possible and indian guest was there before us. Room was clean, had everything you need, cooking stuff, plates, coffee maker, everything! We settled in and walked across the street to the grocery store and stocked up! Loved the fact that there was a full kitchen! Awesome! Beds were okay, kinda stiff but not bad. Cable in the rooms and free wifi for 4 phones! All worked well and we had no issues. the rooms are outdated and could use some better upkeep but it did the job for us.

We spent our days at the pool which was AWESOME kids loved it! The slides were a big hit! They have a gift store which I found to be reasonable priced. Beer there is so much cheaper then going into the bar, so my tip is buy beer at the gift store! Plenty of sitting for the pool area which was great. I wish they had servers though, if you do want a drink you have to go to the bar. The restaurant was ok-good and I didn't think pricing was extreme at all. I will say though, one day they had offered a coconut drink, when I ordered it, the girl couldn't open the coconuts to make the drink so she just said sorry we can't make them.... well don't offer them if you can make it LOL or go ask for help! They also have buy one drink get the second free and happy hour times, however its only on there very basic drinks..... also another tip we learned at the end, for the kids sodas, have them save there cups because refills are free! I didn't no and no one told us so I kept buying them each time! UGH I guess I should have asked, I found out on our last day to just save the cups.

At night, we went to the strip at night and Fremont street, we took Lyft which was anywhere from $23-35 bucks each way... it was little much but we wanted off the strip so thats what you get LOL I guess the resort use to have a shuttle, I think that would have been awesome if they bring that back!

Upon check out, it was easy and there was no extra charges or anything. I would come back here again if I was bringing kids or family with elderly people because it is very low key and relaxed. We enjoyed our selfs very much!",4,Je7ukWBtHZQo7XzgbmdTGA

Instead of explaining everything, I'm copying and pasting my answer to one of their survey questions.

\"What could have been done to make your stay better?\" (The wording may not be 100% but you get the gist). 
Here was my answer:

Fixing the master bedroom door would have been good. Couldn't easily close the door because it was rubbing so hard on the carpet. 

Picking up the phone when I called would have been good. 

Having the TV in the living room working when we first walked in would have been good. But it took for me to plug in the living room phone to call the front desk 7 times (only picked up twice in two days) and walking to the makeshift lobby to complain about the TV to actually get someone to look at it.

Housekeeping leaving trash bags and dirty laundry out in the hallway all day actually sucked. We were kind of embarrassed when a guest came to visit us.

Replacing the missing closet door in the master bedroom would been good.

Sound proofing. Sound proofing would be really great! We could hear every person walking, talking, laughing and arguing in the hall very clearly. Same with people on the balconies, we could hear their whole conversation.",0,DUWuD-eNmGH4inNFiGA6AA

Go to Motel 6, at least there you wont be woken up by your neighbors and your possessions wont be stolen. My husband, inlaws and I checked in for a 3 night stay. We left to go downtown on our first night and  upon returning noticed our room had been gone through and some of our possessions stolen. We told security and were informed we did not need to call the police as it was all handled in house. We learned that was a lie. They only deal with people through mail and a month later they sent a copy of where I signed stating they were not responsible for stolen items. So what I gather from this place is that their employees are allowed to steal because guests sign a waiver. This is the worst place I have ever stayed! No wonder the is a massive lawsuit against diamond resorts. They are all thieves,  manipulators and con artists. They hold you captive at their presentations and use scare tactics to try to get you to sign up, even going so far as to disclose the personal info of others to get you to buy.

Pool: The pool slides were sooo much fun. They let you take snacks and drinks to the pool area or you can bbq on the grills. There is a security guard that checks your coolers, you are not allowed to bring your own alcohol to the pool. There is a alcohol bar/snack bar where you can get your drinks a d food. The pool area felt safe for the kids, you didn't have a bunch of drunks all over the pool area.  I ordered the pina colada, it was delicious! The pool area is huuuge you never bump in to people. 

Room: The room was perfect, it had everything you can think off. You don't need to bring anything, they provide all the pots and pans you need, kitchen utensils. shampoo, conditioner, wine opener, etc.  The living room  and kitchen area is pretty big.  The sofa turns into a bed, they provide a lot of extra pillows, sheets, and blankets. 

Activities: They had activities going on through out the day from bingo to making your own sundae.

Strip: To my surprise it is located on Vegas Blvd, you pretty much drive  a few lights down and you get to the strip. This worked out perfect for us, we had fun at the pool during the day then headed to the strip at night with the boys. I definitely think this is my new favorite Vegas spot!

There were 3 ladies per room.  

The first issue was with Room 246*.  The high temperature during our stay was 108-110.  The room did not cool down when we returned from being out Friday night.  The next morning, Maintenance was called and advised us that there is an issue with the air conditioning cooling down the second bedroom throughout the resort and offered to bring a fan.  Side note:  Upon exiting, Maintenance was alerted that the remote control in room 246* was not working.  The fan did not help in cooling off the room so Sunday another one of the ladies went to the front desk and maintenance was sent up again and somehow fixed the unit.  
Sunday morning in Room 226*, 2 of the ladies had several bites on their person which they assumed to be spider bites.  They called the front desk and an incident report was taken and they requested the room be sprayed.  The resort reached out Tuesday, July 16, 2019 and advised the room tested positive for bed bugs.  The major issue is that all 9 ladies were in and out the room fellow shipping and potentially spreading the bed bugs and contaminating the other rooms from July 13 - July 15.  Also, notifying that the room tested positive for bed bugs the day after check-out did not allow us to mitigate contaminating our residences.  Also, 1 of the ladies went to the doctors due to the bites and was put on antibiotics.
Room 246* had an issue with the remote control that was not formally reported as Maintenance handled it after they brought the fan to room 246*.  The ADA bathroom also had an extremely dirty bath mat, blood on the shower curtain and 2 dirty white towels in with the clean towels.

It's unprofessional. My family and I decided to go for a late night swim. I called the lobby and asked what time they closed. They told me at 10pm. We showed up at 8:45pm thinking we had a good time to swim. 9pm hits and the lifeguards start their closing procedures kicking everybody out of the pool. Ummmm...what happened to 10 o clock? First of all 10 pm is a ridiculous time to close a pool, especially in VEGAS! If they're going to kick everyone out of the pools at 9, state that the pool closes at 9. Not 10!!! That's horrible communication. Another note, around 8:50 lifeguards picked up our fresh towels from our chairs saying they were closing. My 2 brothers that were in the pool came back to no towels, and walked to the room wet and cold. When we told a lifeguard what happened their response was, \"there's more towels at the fitness center\" That was so unprofessional from the life guards. I also noticed the life guards were a very young group of people. I wonder how they would truly act if a real emergency would happen. Anyway another thing that was ridiculous was that housekeeping is now an extra charge at this resort. Who does that? My parents have time share ownership and pay cleaning fees every three months.

The pros: the hotel does offer some great amenities such as the pool, several hot tubs and hammocks for those that have kids and /or are looking to relax away from the strip. Definitely kid friendly and there is a presence of Life guards at the pool.  The rooms do come equipped with a kitchen and a coffee maker (many hotels on the strip no longer offer coffee in the rooms and instead make you hike down to the casino floor to a cafe, so that was a win).

The cons: the place is run a bit like a car dealership. Expect to see their sales team everywhere. The hotel rooms are outdated and need a little TLC. Our room was on the 1st floor and was very dark. They don't stop by and clean the rooms everyday - this must be a timeshare thing - just expect to do you own housekeeping unless you are staying longer than 4 days.  We had to make our bed upon arrival and dig through the cabinets to find the sheets.  We could only have 2 devices on the wifi before they charge you for it. It is a little way south of the strip.

All in all not terrible but not great either.  Location isn't awful if you are looking for a place to relax away from the strip.

I had to call my friend, pull her away from her job, and bring here down to pay for a small tab, despite fact I'd been staying for over two weeks at that point and had no problems paying until then.

CHECK IN: Check in was fairly easy and quick and they give you a parking pass for your vehicle that you definitely should use. They also give you a sheet of paper and instruct you to go visit the concierge for more information. Being that I'm very familiar with this town after living here so long I knew that visiting the info desk after checking in would only result in a lengthy sales pitch and I wasn't interested in that... after I walked out the front door the salesperson followed us out and asked if we wanted discounts. I ignored him.

PARKING: Parking was free for guests and we were directed to park in an underground garage (out of the sun). Also another benefit is the hotel elevator goes down to that parking garage so I don't have to hit the lobby and see the sales people who want to get you to buy their timeshares (another score).

ROOM: The hallways looked freshly renovated..but \"wow\" was the first word that came out of my mouth when I entered the room. It had a full kitchen a nice size dining room table two bathrooms with two showers and a separate bedroom. Another perk of the room was it had a very spacious balcony. The room was a little on the smaller side but I really enjoyed the layout and staying in it. If you go out on the porch at night, just know that the light does not turn off and if you leave the door open the light attracts bugs.

POOL: this pool is phenomenal, large waterfall coming down a temple like structure. The pool is large enough so that a big crowd of people can use it and still feel comfortable. There are several hot tubs to use and many BBQ grills to use as well. The one thing I didn't understand is that the towel Hut is over at the fitness center which is way away from the entrance to the pool. The pool had plenty of seating and was the perfect temperature to swim in. I really wish I could spend more time there.

ROOM SERVICE: I decided to try room service and found it was at a very reasonable cost. When the food comes they don't really set it up for you on a tray like at the fancy or hotels they just show up with to-go boxes and that's that. The food from room service was okay, nothing to write home about just seems like typical pub-style food.

All in all for the staycation I had in the price I paid I thought it was very good. And I can't see any reason why I wouldn't stay here again",1,fCExFIeu2BT35FSx2Yz2aA

The staff is super friendly and wonderful, the rooms are comfortable, there is FREE laundry, our room had 2 bathrooms, the cafe is great, the pools/spas are awesome, and everything is fantastic overall.

However, the timeshare experience completely ruined my impression of Diamond Resorts as a whole and I will never stay at another Diamond Resort hotel again. Ever. I'd rather camp out by a dumpster. 

Pro-tip: Absolutely DO NOT accept the timeshare bribe. Don't do it. It's a trap. I should've known when they casually asked about my income and relationship status. Invasive much?

They said it would take about an hour. It took 3 hours. 

Dale and Jonah. Oh boy. Where do I begin. Upon greeting us, Dale asked us what drugs we did at EDC and gave us explicit details of his love life throughout the tour. This was the most unprofessional and tasteless sales pitch I've experienced. 2 hours into trying to sell us a timeshare, Dale gave up and Jonah stepped in. Jonah was extremely abrasive and assaulting towards my friend and I. How do you expect someone to give you $$$ when you are literately yelling in their face? After they both gave up, a friendly woman was sent in to salvage the meeting. Honestly, had we started with her, it would have gone a lot better. She was actually super nice and professional but it was too little too late. 

Had it not been for the whole timeshare mishap, I would have given Cancun Resort Las Vegas 5 stars. The resort itself is fantastic. The timeshare experience is literately hell. What an unfortunate way to end this trip. I'm honestly embarrassed for this resort. Absolutely never again.",15,ttlejhD6hnAKoEpE-8UAFA

I have never been to this hotel but it is beautiful on the outside with green palm trees and grass. A modern day oasis in the desert. There is even security that is very tight and guests have to be announced before they can even enter. This is a great safety precaution. 

After passing through security my sister met me at the front door and we walked up to the room and hung out for just a few. Then since kids are kids and if you promise them pool, they will not leave you alone till you deliver. We took our party to the pool and decided to go for a dip. The pools are huge and have water slides. I am so impressed with the pool area there is so much shade and with the long hot summer days one can enjoy the pool even in the heat of the day here. We decided to stay at the pool for about 4 hours and make sure the kids were really tired. It was successful too!

We ordered pizza for dinner since no one felt in the mood for cooking after sun bathing for most of the day. The kitchen in the hotel room has a full set up with stove and fridge. The bed is in a separate bedroom and is so fluffy . Plus if you request it they will come and provide turn down service and fluff those pillows for you.",20,I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA

The place was clean and employees were circulating the different areas.  We went during the tot time and especially loved that there were no big Kids! It was pretty crowded given it was the first week of tot time and a Friday. The line to get in was very long, about a 30 min wait. We got there at 10, and the line was already starting to wrap, by 11, it was not only wrapped it was around to the other side of the door. The line continued steady until about noon.  This was with an employee at the door making sure waivers were filled out before getting to the counter.  They need to figure out a way to expedite this process, because there were melt downs happening up and down the line.  Several in our mommy group turned back because the lines.  Had my mother in law not offered to help the lady behind us with her crying children, I'm sure she would have given up too. Maybe they can do online check in and pay?  Once in, my son was off having a blast.  The only problem was he was going too fast to watch or keep up with.  He would go up one set of stairs I thought led to a slide then not come down because it led to Lots of choices! The upstairs play structures have cool clear fiber glass cut outs, that my son was scared of falling thru, but once i showed him it was ok, we found a cut out that had no fiberglass and was an actual hole- very confusing and dangerous! The provided parent lounge had comfy couches, cartoons and massage chairs (for a fee). It was nice when we needed a break and several mom's were in there feeding their babies.  Although, I wish it was at the front of the building so parents could keep an eye on the exit. 

However, the BIGGEST DOWNFALL of this place is they have no check out procedure.  They stationed an adult at the door to make sure no stragglers ran out, but had/ have no way to identify that the person taking the child out, is the person who should.  This made me a bit leary losing my toddler in the crowd, so I attempted to keep up with him and suggest you do as well.  

I would highly recommend this place look into and revise their security procedures to ensure this it is not a place that makes it easy for kids to be snatched.  I hate to think like that, but Arizona has a high rate of child trafficking; it can't be something they ignore.  Maybe they can look into something like makutus island-  gated exit and matching wristbands with names that are checked upon exit. After all, this place could be awesome, but safety should be priority  #1.

Overall, we had a fun time.  But be prepared to wait to get in, dress to be able to chase your child, and don't forget the grippy socks. Oh, and while there is room for strollers, it's better to leave them at home.  They made it awkward for others to maneuver around, and took up a lot of room in the toddler zone.",4,5bVUzScjS2VRy6hc1BSBjg

It's not bad, the first time. But the workers are always on it. Reminding people with certain color wrist bands it's time to leave. Then birthday announcements. Then rules. Reminders. Never ends. 

That's my only real complaint. But it's bad enough to deduct two stars.

EDIT: I'm changing this to one star because they implemented a \"new system\" that is garbage. It didn't keep some of the information we entered into it so when we got to the front desk they didn't see it on their end and couldn't fix it.   Their junk system we have to redo. And then the card reader wouldn't accept our signature. It kept trying to clear it. So we re did everything and still had to waste ten minutes at the front counter. 

Alrhough I will admit, the girl at the front counter was extremely nice and apologetic. She's probably had to deal with a ton of mad customers because the owner or management decided to implement this new system that probably saved them $10 upfront but are too stupid to understand the 10 minutes wasted on us and every other customer, every day, equals tens of thousands of dollars.

I used to go to Romados almost on a twice weekly basis as a university student, resorting to means such as pushing a Car2Go in snowstorms to travel halfway across town for my chicken fix or going for protein-rich \"healthy\" fill-up after hitting the gym, ha!

Romados is iconic for cheap & fast charcoal-grilled Portuguese chicken served with an absurd amount of fries, all brushed with oily spicy piri-piri sauce. Don't forget the Sumol or a soft drink or 1L of water to wash that down cuz gosh I'm always devouring the thing so fast that it's hard on the tubes.

My only complaint about Romados is consistency of the food. From one day to the next, the chicken ranges from texture-perfect to overly-dry to stayed-in-the-warming-tray for too long. From perfectly seasoned fries to major salt attack. That's why when the fire happened and Ma Poule Mouillée opened, I became a regular of the new kids on the block instead. Now that Ma Poule Mouillée also caught on fire, guess where I'm back at.

Although there are many better/more consistent joints nearby, Romados remains for me the OG of this city's overstuffed Portuguese chicken meals.

Tips:
- The half-chicken set meal is really big (appropriate for 2 ppl)
- Get some Pastel de nata, the custard tarts
- Did I mention salt attack? Don't tell my doctor, please
- Places takes debit/credit, no AMEX
- Call ahead to skip the line
- Seating is limited, please share",2,JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw

I ordered the Asian style wonchos and they were phenomenal! The pulled pork was tender, and there was enough to have a bite of meat with each woncho. That is what really attracted me to the dish, as that is unheard of with most restaurant style nachos. 

The seasoning was a tad salty, but paired well with the pork and veggies. You could especially tell that the onions that they included were fresh.

The Las Vegas Convention Center was easy to find and navigate. Parking was $10.00 and plentiful. We arrived 2 hours after opening and had to park across the street( less than 5 min walk). We noticed the monorail right across the street from the Convention Center. Price of admission was fair, we scored a discount by buying early.

There were a lot of different costumes. Everyone was very friendly when asked to pose for photos. There were a variety of different artist selling prints and comic books,and giving autographs. In addition different panels offered workshops and info sessions on characters and future projects. Kids activities were plentiful everything from games,face painting art classes kept my little ones excited. In addition booths offered t-shirts,comics,pins,cups etc.There was something for everyone.

We were able to bring in snacks and drinks.  In the main lobby were several food options with reasonable prices. An ATM was conveniently located by the main entrance.The venue was very clean and organized as well as perfectly air conditioned.

I've been doing Comic-Cons since 2016. I've attended Southern California Cons like Wondercon, Comikaze, Long Beach (Con and Expo), Anime Expo, and other Cons like Phoenix, San Francisco, and Seattle. 

I think Amazing Las Vegas is just getting big enough to fit into that \"just right\" Con size, not super-packed and crazy, but not too small. 

There were quite a few Cosplayers (I would have liked to have seen more), plenty of vendors, a good selection of artists, and I attended a very well-done Panel on the Star Wars franchise. 

There was a nice food court right outside the Hall. 

My only complaint was the beer selection: they only had Bud Light! C'mon, you can do better than that!

The booths are setup in a way that makes sense and are easy to navigate. The staff also seem very on top of things, especially when it comes to directing crowds and controlling lines. 

The actual attendees are usually very polite and enthusiastic about being there. The exhibitors also offer unique artwork and one of a kind products. This year, there was everything from artwork printed on metal to hand drawn artwork to handmade dragon stuffed animals with various designs. The prices, for a convention, are decent, and artists usually offer deals.

The only drawback this year was the attitude of the South Point staff, especially in the concession stands. While I know that this is not something the Con staff can control, it still affects the overall feeling of the event. This past Con, it seemed that they were not really prepared for this crowd. There were only two registers at each window, and I believe there were only 2 windows in the entire venue, and the one I was at had a register down for about 20 minutes. And instead of ringing us up at the other, usable register, the employee forced us to wait for the broken register to become available again, all the while people who were behind us in line were being rung up. Oh, and did I mention that they had already brought our food out, and set it in front of us?

The little snafu with the concession stand did not take away from the experience, however, it did still make me grumpy.

When I found out that he was opening up just down the street from my place, I knew I had to check it out. 

The Resurva booking system is fantastic because I can easily see exactly what times are available, as well as having the ability to cancel and reschedule within seconds. The barbershop is typical old school which in reality is quite charming. There is no pretentious design or stuck up feeling here. The best part is often coming through the door and chatting with Brian and his current client as you wait for your turn. The conversations are always quite interesting and even for someone in their very early twenties, I always love spending 30-45 mins at the barbershop chatting as Brian does his work.

The haircuts are absolutely unbelievable. The cuts go way beyond anything you have ever experienced and his attention to detail is remarkable. Brian had posted on Instagram a few months ago that his goal is to ensure that the haircut looks just as good grown in (in two weeks), as it does when it's fresh.

At the end of the day though, it's Brian who makes the shop what it is. I've yet to meet someone so humble and he goes above and beyond for his clients. I had asked him if people tend to shave in their part after a week or so once it grows in. Brian told me not to bother, and to just come in whenever I needed the part to be re-shaved in. I've asked barbers in the past for something small like that, and most will say they are too busy, etc. 

Brian is one of the best in Toronto and if you truly appreciate a fine hair cut and service that goes above and beyond, I'd suggest you give him a shot. All you should do is take a look at the Nite Owl's Instagram and look at the incredible work he does.",5,ulfKUxoWoFDGE4pFc10gRw

I guess they don't want a brunch crowd? We were waiting for friends and I specifically asked the waiter if it'd be a problem if we ordered breakfast a few minutes after 11 once our friends got there.

The chicken tinga tostadas were plated nicely and full of meat and toppings. It comes with a side soup which I thought was salty, which was opposite of the red chile. This dish was better than the red chile though, but I wouldn't come back to try anything else.

The pants were folded, not a huge deal, but not what I asked for either. As I was putting everything away, I started to notice that some items were missing.  I texted the number from earlier and didn't get a prompt response so I called. The person on the phone was able to find the missing items and I immediately headed back in.

My latte (lacking the art) was not the type of drink I have come to enjoy, just gave that strong bitter taste I'm not a fan of. My friend also noted her drink was not amazing (can't recall what she got though).

A couple stores have changed since this plaza has opened, but there have been shops that have been here for decades, like the store that sells popcorn and cotton candy.

Have purchased a number of items here and have always been satisfied.  From lawn mower to snow blower (at a huge discount), and ladder to toilet---everything performs beautifully.   

They also have a general 90 day return policy which I took advantage of because of faulty solar lights that stopped working after just 2 months.  Never had to return anything else because they all work---whether blowing, mowing, growing, brushing, or flushing.  

Especially satisfied with their outdoor plants.  Always healthy when purchased and continue to flourish---annuals, perennials, and herbs.  House plants, too.   And if you're looking for any larger decorative garden pieces, such as metal trellises, gates, panels, and shepherd hooks, they have quite a nice selection.  

Because a vast section of their outdoor garden center is open at the top---like an enormous cage in a zoo, but without roofing on one side---don't be surprised to be looking at something and all of sudden birds fly past---right in front of you---just two feet away---at eye level.

Huge place with great design. Hipster vibe. Hipsters are working behind the counter as well. Hard to get their attention, as already mentioned. Felt cold there and not because of the lack of heat, but because of the workers and the whole room.

Anyway, tea was as tea usually. Liked the mug, as it is bigger than those fancy little tea cups, which are not enough for me. Pastry was great, as we love sweets. Should have eaten double the amount to be really satisfied. No complaints there. The table was tiny, but I love those European style small cafe tables. More excitement while sharing it with few other people.

The location is prime and the brick building is excellent. It has vast floor space compared with most coffee shops, and plenty of little round tables. They even have a row faux leather armchairs at the tables against the wall, and seating at the window ledge. I have never bought coffee or coffee brewing equipment here. The Green Beanery's selection of both is extensive (possibly even comprehensive). The atmosphere is lovely and the merchandise is attractively displayed. I appreciate their pioneering commitment to being 'beyond fair trade and organic' sourcing. The company's commitment to social justice is one of the prime reasons for my loyalty. The establishment as a glass door vault it rents out as meeting room. I would love to hold acrimonious business meeting there. The Green Beanery has only one large washroom for its patrons. There is occasionally a line up for this washroom, and I have given up a few times. It is a large, clean and well equiped washroom, with plenty of hooks to hang one's bags, coat, scarf, etc. The Green Beanery has recently improved its waste diversion facilities. I give it 5/5 for the accomodations. 

The Green Beanery's product range is decent. It's coffee is very good. It's regular cappuccino is on the small size for the price (about $3.50). The americanos are good. The tea use to consist of Stash bagged tea. They switched in the last year to loose leaf. I selected a milk oolong once, and it oddly did not have any milk aroma. The Green Beanery's ice tea is excellent and affordably priced. I enjoyed both the lemon black iced tea and the raspberry hisbiscus (nice tartiness for hot, muggy weather). They have recently started serving iced Earl Grey tea, which tasts delicious). I give the Green Beanery 4/5 for their coffee & tea. 

I use to eat their over-priced bagel sandwiches (veggie and cheese or smoked salmon and cream cheese). They were ordinary, tasty white flour bagel sandwiches. In 2015 The Green Beanery added a selection of ready made sandwiches. These were expensive and good. I especially liked the pulled pork sandwich. This year they have added a selection of crepes, which take a few minutes to make. The crepes are well made and priced comparably with other crepe establishments in town.The Green Beanery also offers a large selection of sweet baked goods. The Green Beanery also serves Greg's Ice Cream (Toasted Marshmallow and Espresso Toffee delicious). On the healthier side, The Green Beanery has lauched a selection of smoothies and pressed fruit juices. I tried their Pineapple Mango smoothie. It tasted bizarrely fishy and its consistency was too thick to be sucked throught the tiny straw provided. I give the Green Beanery 3/5 for their food menu.

The customer service at the Green Beanery is bad. It is the reason I try to avoid the establishment. I prefer to spend time at the Second Cup, where the servers are usually polite and often friendly. The customer service at The Green Beanery is at best indifferent and detached, and at its worse arrogant and negligent. The Green Beanery hires servers from all demographics, yet they all conditionned to treat the customers' orders (not special requests, but simple orders) as an unavoidable nuisances. I do not understand why these young people cannot treat the customers to ensure their employment with courtesy, if not warmth. It is as though they preceive service work as a humiliation the world is forcing upon them. They appear to stocially endure the customers' presence and demands, and act to make our interaction as brief as possible. Were they trafficked to The Green Beanery by corrupt art school teachers and acting coachs to work as barista slaves? The servers at the Green Beanery seem only interested in gossiping among themselves and slowing cleaning equipment, and notice customers with all the enthusiasm of preparing for a bowel movement. I am usually an extravagant tipper (25%-30%), because my parents are immigrants who found employment in restaurants. The Green Beanery is the first establishment I have ever frequented where I make it a rule to not tip at all. I have used The Green Beanery as an example of what is lacking in Toronto's customer service culture. I can remember exactly three times when a server in The Green Beanery as gone beyond the bare necessities of service and actually treated me nicely. (One young Asian woman was very sweet natured when I purchased my first Earl Grey iced tea.) I am surprised to experience even chilly courteous at the Green Beanery. The management seems disinterested or incapable of changing the company's service culture. I give The Green Beanery 1/5 for customer service.",4,eUCgJ3V3e1zPEvRA8MGu6A

One extremely welcome feature of this place is their reliable long hours.  Toronto's annoyingly early closing times are a common and valid complaint on yelp, and I'm always happy to find a place that keeps more reasonable hours.

The coffee, to my not-very-sophisticated tastes, is very good.  I usually get a large cappucino -- it could be a little bit stronger for my liking, but it's smooth and overall very pleasant.  There is also a good selection of Stash teas (alas, bagged only).  The selection of baked goodies is rather impressive, and all I've tried so far have not disappointed.  There is also a small selection of savoury items such as bagel sandwiches.  Nothing special, but very welcome, since I often try to combine lunch and good coffee. (That's the reason linuxcaffe and Saving Gigi and my favourite cafes in the city -- kickass coffee + kickass food + free wi-fi... but I digress...)

The cafe is airy and spacious, with tall windows that allow for great people-watching, especially if you sit on the taller bar stools.  I like the decor -- elegant, stylish, and coffee-centred.  No mismatched furniture here -- everything looks fresh and sharp (except for the chairs that are extremely soft and comfy :-)).  [Correction -- apparently there is no free wi-fi!  I wonder what network I managed to \"catch\" there, assuming it was the cafe's...  Damn, this definitely makes me want to yank another star off the rating!]

The selection of reading materials is pretty small and rather odd -- for example, they don't carry the Now Magazine, which is a staple at most such establishments.  Instead, they have National Post.

I agree with the comment made by another reviewer below -- the servers always seem to be too busy...  it's not even necessarily that they are slow, but they do seem to give the impression that taking your order and making you coffee is not the main reason they are there.  It may indeed have something to do with the fact that this place is half retail store (and that gives the otherwise great space a rather cluttered, disorganized look).  Ironically, I noticed that retail customers feel just as semi-ignored here: I remember a poor guy who stared at a line-up, confused, trying to figure out whom to ask about different models of coffee grinders on display (he eventually managed to ask the question to one of the baristas, and was told to wait for \"just a few minutes\" until the barista finishes making coffee for the customers).  

Now to the major problem with this place, which caused me to knock my rating down to 3 stars from 4 (I even thought about lowering it furher to a 2, despite all the good things above).  The place can get rather dirty. It's not dusty or grungy -- in fact it feels like quite a new, fresh space -- but there is often mess around. Yet the staff just don't seem to care or else are too busy juggling coffee-making and selling coffee-grinders.  The first time I saw an overflowing garbage bin by the coffee pick-up counter, I dismissed it as a one-time incident due to an especially busy day.  However, it's happened often enough that there is definitely a noticeable pattern.  A wrapper on the floor next to a full garbage bin, a puddle of spilled milk -- this sort of stuff is annoying but can be dealt with.  However, the real \"kicker\" happened just yesterday and it might just be disgusting enough to cause me to stop coming here (stop reading now if you're eating or are squeamish).  After enjoying two rather well-made cups of coffee and a delectable pecan butter square, I got up to take a bathroom break.  To my very unpleasant surprise, the washroom greeted me with a rather foul stench and what looked very much like a pool of half-dried urine on the floor.  I think there was other garbage, like bits of tissue lying about, but I really did not stop to take it all in.  I backed out of there ASAP and decided that my bathroom break could wait until I got home...

If they cleaned the place up, it'd be a solid 4 instead of a shaky 3 I give it right now.",1,1XvktN5JzRkbrpt_T1MzPA

Pros: Had a Costa Rican coffee.  I've been to Costa Rica and it tasted the exact same. It wasn't watered down, but had a nice dark smooth flavour.  So definite points for that.  Also had a great assortment of coffee accessories and they have their own roasting room.  

Cons: A bit slow.  I was the 3rd person in line and still took about 3-5 minutes to get my drip coffee.  

Verdict:  Nice coffee shop with real coffee and makes you appreciate the effort that goes into making coffee.",3,pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w

My partner and I came here from Insomnia to get some work done on our laptop. Unfortunately they don't offer wi-fi here. It is not necessary a bad thing as they may be promoting for more conversation engagement at this cafe. 

The baristas were all friendly and quite efficient with service. There's one washroom that requires a code located at the bottom of your receipt, or else just ask the barista. They also have a section in the cafe where you can browse and shop for coffee pots or beans. 

I won't come here to study again as it's too loud and there's no Wifi. But likely if I come here to catch up with someone! I ordered their mocha and it was great.",1,Vz_JxxxK-I8lijMJjS-iYA

They're most commonly seen around Wondering Tortoise, if you do want to try it.
The food they sell is more Mexican, but also kinda experimental. 

I got the mix it up tacos 3 for $7. Two El Pastors and one El Chorizo. 
The  El Pastors were good, it had pineapple salsa and pork, the El Chorizo was chicken with your basic cilantro and salsa. All three were absolutely delicious, they tasted fresh and clean.

I also had a side order of fries, which was perfectly crispy and tender.

Would recommend trying them out.",2,OKCdcakMZIIYoLyg7b0fEg

There was a red head girl in black pants, a white shirt (not blouse) with the sleeves cut off and hemmed so yea, a professional wife beater shirt I guess and thin strap sandals.  Not professional business attire at all! The girl in the black dress had cute trendy platform shoes on, however the dress was too short to be business professional. She looked like she should be working at Francesca's. The girl with the gray dress on looked fine and was in business attire.  However, she was your hostess, not a sales person. I'm not saying that you're not capable of running a great store, but it all starts with first impressions.  Get your team to dress better. These brides are looking for their fairy tale to come true and be treated like a princess, not shopping for their summer attire at Tillys. It's a special day for brides from engagement to the end of their wedding day. Im glad you're a small business, that's why we visited your store. It just wasn't the best one we visited.

-7OJbmADnDB3OYJR-McKoA,0,2019-09-12 05:23:22,0,yVo-SNBVt6v2TirqHgbYNw,1.0,"I am pretty discouraged from my experience with Ivory Row. To start from the beginning, I booked an appointment April 28th for 6 of 7 of my bridesmaids, my mom, and flower girl (10 of us total). I found Ivory Row due to them carrying the bridesmaids dresses I liked, Sorella Vita. I was so excited as the bride to go through the experience of my girls picking out their dresses. We showed up and were told they only booked an hour for all 10 of us even with knowing my numbers before hand. We felt super rushed and the fun experience soon turned into a stressful one with girls debating on using their storage area to change to speed things up after we were told a bride was book and we couldn't keep the room. In the end they allowed us to move over to the other space until the next bride showed up, but still very rushed and stressful. I let it go and was happy when all the girls got dresses they loved and measurements were taken. 

4 months later the dresses arrived and I never imagined the anxiety this store would cause me.. almost all my bridesmaids dresses were not the correct size. Two were 2-3 inches too small and wouldn't zip, one was ordered in the incorrect size due to paperwork error, and one will zip but she can't breath. Only 3 of the 7 dresses ordered seemed reasonable sized, but will still need alterations, which we understood some alterations would be required. 

I immediately was on the phone with the store when I found out the one dress was a 12 when she requested an 8 due to being 6 months pregnant at the time of her fitting. I was assured they would correct the error and asked for her to come in for a fitting with Ellie. Then more and more calls came in from my girls stating their dresses were not fitting. One of the girls called me crying. I went with two of the three girls to meet with Ellie the owner to see what could be done. 

I was told the girl who took the measurements/sizes no longer worked there and it was unfortunate she was not trained properly in ordering up rather than down when measurements were in between. Ellie was pleasant enough during our visit and I was hopeful she would correct this error for at least 3-4 of the dresses ordered. She said she'd take out two of the them for the appointments I attended. With this said, we had to hear how much money she was losing and how she was not carrying that line of bridesmaids dresses due to the many errors she has to fix. As the bride I did not care, I wanted my problem fixed that was at hand. I thought all would be ok until I got a distraught call from the third girl a few days later who got the dress they actually ordered incorrectly as a 12. She just had a baby and is still swollen from an emergency c-section, Ellie told her if she had ordered an 8 it would be too small she would only take in the waist. The top is huge on her and now she is going to have to get not only alterations on the waist once swelling goes down in a few weeks (probably to the size 8 measurements) but also take in the bust drastically. Ellie got on the phone with me and told me the same story about how she's loosing money. She refused to speak to my mom (who I called crying for help) and then refused to come out of her office to speak to my Bridesmaid and her husband who drove all the way from flagstaff. Ellie still has not called any of us back. The 4th girl had an appointment that was cancelled by Ivory Row and she felt uncomfortable going in knowing the experience of the others after that. 

I was hopeful this would have been made right, but it was not the dress still don't fit, even the two she \"fixed\" are too small. As a bride I already am super stressed, this isn't something I should be worrying about. I never imagined we would get the wrong size dresses nor be treated the way we were by an owner. If we were treated right and the problem corrected I probably wouldn't have shared this review and let the fitting experience slide, but I wanted to warn others to be weary before ordering their dresses from Ivory Row, this is a very unfortunate situation, and avoidable. I feel we have been respectful and reasonable in trying to find a solution with Ellie.",4,ax6Z8RQF20wFF_hu7S9Oxg

The ease of the process working with the bridal assistants to Ellie the owner was so amazing and I'm forever grateful they made my wedding dress experience perfect. Ellie was very accommodating with setting up my fitting appointments and rearranging when I needed to reschedule(since I live in California) I could not thank her enough! Ellie also recreated my mother's 41 year old veil so I could wear it down the aisle and it means so much to me she was happy and willing to fix it! As brides we know how stressful the entire process of planning a wedding is and I'm so happy finding my dress was not part of that stress. Can't wait to wear my perfect dress in 5 weeks!!

We strolled in on Tuesday at lunchtime.  At this time of day I figured service should be spot on.  The guys at the counter had a lot of technical difficulties.  They couldn't get their iPad register to work.  Then they said they would take a picture of my groupon to get the barcode but then their iPhone didn't work.  Then they tried to mark my Groupon as redeemed on my phone and the site was down (they were pretty put out and asked me to keep trying).  I was thinking to myself \"They better not make me pay for this when I have a groupon!\"  In the end, we got our food but this was WAY TOO difficult.  With this much difficulty, they should have just given me the food for free anyways for all the trouble.  

What about the pizza in a cone?  I liked it!  It's definitely a novelty but I thought it was tasty.  I recommend getting toppings because then it's not just a big 3D cone of cheese.  I got the Supreme Cone and it was hot and tasty.  The only thing is that the grease from the cheese gets all contained in the cone so you definitely eat all of it and it makes it a little hard to eat in the beginning.  The fries were hot and crispy and delicious.  

All in all, I liked it.  I would eat it again next time I am feeling the urge to be unhealthy.  I encourage everyone to try it at least once---c'mon people, it's pizza in a cone!",1,SX_SMrddkDU5dySbsZMu9A

For that matter, why aren't there more foods on sticks? If anyone figures out how to get a spaghetti dinner on a stick, I'll be your first investor.

In case you haven't figured it out by now, I'm a big fan of portable food. I've been dying to try this place ever since I walked by it a few months ago and saw their slogan adorning the front of the building: \"Pizza not flat anymore!\"  So pizza is no longer flat AND there's no need to use verbs anymore?!  I've seen the future, and it is glorious.

Anyway, so as I was saying, I've been wanting to come here for awhile. As if reading my mind, Groupon suddenly drops a well-timed email into my inbox this weekend -- $9 for two cones and two fries at Pizza Cono. Sold!

We went yesterday for lunch. I wanted to try the white pizza cone, but I'm not a fan of ricotta cheese. So I asked for it sans ricotta, but to my surprise, they could not accommodate my request -- apparently all of the gourmet cones are pre-made, so you can't make any changes. BOO! The best they could do was to make me a \"build your own cone\" with broccoli in an attempt to replicate the white cone (except it had red sauce, which totally isn't the same thing...I don't know why they don't have white sauce as a build your own option). Anyway, so that was mine, and the hubster ordered the Hawaiian cone.

It took about 20 minutes to make our food. I get why it takes a long time...they need to thoroughly cook like 5+ inches of toppings deep in the cone instead of just a thin layer on the top of a regular pizza slice. So I didn't come in here expecting fast food. That being said, it would be nice if they had a TV or something to help keep people occupied and fill the awkward silence in the shop coming from everyone just sitting and waiting for their food.

Our cones and fries arrived piping hot. I eagerly dove into my masterpiece, drooling with anticipation...and it did not disappoint! The cone crust was perfectly thin but chewy. The red sauce was flavorful, with chunks of basil throughout. And there was so much bubbly, brown, gooey cheese. Ohhh how I loved the cheese. The broccoli, which I was skeptical about, worked surprisingly well in the melange of cheese and red sauce. Each bite was more delish than the next. The fries were really tasty too...thick, battered, and crispy. My hubby reported that his Hawaiian cone was also a winner. His only complaint was that he missed the thick end piece of crust that you get when you finish a slice of regular pizza. I can't say that I agree, since I always leave a trail of crust scraps in my wake when I eat pizza....so pizza in a cone is perfect for me. But I guess if you love the thick crust at the end, you might miss that too like my ol' hubster.

Anyway, so cone as a pizza delivery mechanism = great success. My meal here definitely didn't fall flat. Get it?! FLAT?? 

Seriously, spaghetti dinner on a stick. Somebody make it happen.",5,0EhPIlDozxGKpbbHRr6vZg

3 1/2 stars for Service: I actually feel bad for only giving Scott 3 1/2 stars. ( Because remember they switched our server.) He was very attentive for as absent as he was. I think his other tables were in the big room. We ordered drinks and an appetizer. Drinks arrived and we ordered our entrees.He said he would bring bread. Which took another 10 minutes to arrive. The food runner then tried to give our entrees to the table behind us. ( who had already finished dinner) Our appetizer never did arrive. Scott was very apologetic and offered us desserts.
4 stars for food: Our drinks were delicious. I enjoyed my French Pear. The white bean pesto served with bread was delicious.  I ordered the winter squash ravioli and was impressed. For dessert we enjoyed the BC s'more. 
Although the food was delicious I'm not sure I'll return because of the overall experience. Very disappointed.",1,ZZCh16cHCdyfsaGlYHqAqQ

I ordered delivery from Junior using ALCE. My experience was mixed but somewhat negative overall.

I'll start w the bad: the delivery experience was terrible and I don't believe it's ALCE's fault. I ordered 4 items: 2 rice noodles, 1 pork adobo w rice and beans, and 1 pork belly w rice. They were all stacked together w the pork w rice and beans at the bottom of the bag - this was the only dish w liquid sauce. Result: the bag got soaked at the bottom and as the bag was removed from ALCE's carting case, it collapsed... yielding a mess (thankfully, the food was salvageable... but I had to clean the mess). Who stacks a liquid dish at the bottom of heap like that? Why not just use two bags. You know what, I'm ok if they charge me for the extra bag.

Another bad: my order was incomplete (I think). The website claims it comes w sweet Mang Tomas sauce. Either it's invisible or it was omitted. The net result was an ok dish w unmet potential. Again, this is not ALCE's fault since they didn't pack the bag.

The positive: the food was decent. Not great, but fine. Surprisingly, I felt the rice noodles were the best item - despite my strong ex-ante personal inclination towards the pork dishes.

Verdict: I may try again, but definitely not w delivery. I will still use ALCE for other restos since many of my experiences w them (indeed, even the person who delivered this particular time) have been positive and painless. The problems (due to carelessness, I think) were mos def on Junior in this case.",0,RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw

The last time I visited the Buffet, which was several months ago, it had a pretty good BBQ meat station, Mexican station, Asian food station, excellent planked salmon, oysters, shrimp salad, a meat station and sometimes crepes at the dessert station.

Ate here in a party of five because we were staying at the hotel and it was convenient.   By Las Vegas standards, $22 for a buffet is not expensive but by my standards I do expect some good food at that price.  The LVH Buffet failed to deliver.
Basically, nothing was terrible but nothing was like \"Wow, I gotta get me some more of that!\"  Everyone else in my party felt the same.  I had the salmon (dry and tough), chicken Marsala (flavorless).  The turkey was ok, as was the beef and the sausage.  I could find no fault with the shrimp cocktail.  The salad bar was uninspiring and blah - at least have some pepperoni.  
There was unlimited beer and wine -- cheap beer (Hamms) and wine.  Good to get drunk on but alas I had to drive to the airport later that evening, otherwise I would have  tried to drink my money's worth.
The best part of the meal was the soft-serve chocolate ice cream.
We went on a Sunday night and some of the things mentioned in other reviews were not there, namely Mexican food and sushi.  I like both.  My dining experience definitely suffered in their absence.

My boyfriend and I ate at The Buffet twice, once for breakfast ($14.99) and once for their Champagne Brunch ($19.99). I'm a breakfast lover so I was in heaven with all the choices...eggs various styles, bacon, sausage, ham, biscuits, gravy, french toast, pancakes, potatoes, grits, oatmeal, fruit, cereal, desserts, etc. Was it the BEST quality buffet ever...not so much BUT it was good nonetheless. The Champagne Brunch was a bit more impressive, as it should be for $5 more. Unlimited champagne/mimosas, however, I wished they would have served them to us instead of having to go get them from the bartender each time. The buffet included all the breakfast food PLUS chicken, beef, ribs, Asian food, veggies, cold crab legs, etc. 

Not the biggest buffet or the fanciest but no complaints. If I stay at the LVH again I would hit up The Buffet for sure! :)",1,SdyD3VeFsrzeR6WoOhhq4Q

At the time to valet it was $40 to leave your car and $30 to self park, not sure if this is normal or since it is located near the convention center they make money off the people looking for parking, could also be that there is a Monorail stop here.

Friends were staying here and we needed to have brunch and pick them up, we got the parking validated but I think because our friends stood there, a security guard mentioned to play in order to get it waived but if you are not gambling then what.",0,UtmsHIyNNgeVZlm6CYLWjA

The food is pretty good.  My favorite is the Fried Chicken and Mac n Cheese.  The Chicken has a nice, crispy & flaky skin to it with the white meat tender and juicy in the inside.  The Mac n Cheese is thick and gooey....nom nom!

First the allure of fondue is amazing and apparently the multiple times I've visited in the past, I was over served because I did not remember this location to be so run down. The awatukee  location has been around a while and it shows. If your lucky enough to get one of those little Nooks tucked away behind the velvet ropes, enjoy; the view from general admission is ehh at best. 

Ultimately I have no \"complaints\" about the food just turns out boiled filet mignon is not my cup of tea, weird huh? In the future I will strictly melting potting for cheese and chocolate fondues. Begging and end of my meal hit all marks, middle not so much. 

Beer cheese fondue was prime, I also got the remainder of my beer to drink while I watched the cheese boil, yuuum! However the salad was wack, to say the least, if I in fact did pay the suggested $7 on the menu I would throw my plate through that pretty velvet curtain any day. Presentation was purely pathetic a salad made up of croutons, limp iceberg and cheese and a poor excuse for a boiled egg was really just offending. 

The middle, the meat and boiling part. Presentation is done well however a few key elements raised red flags. A- boiling prime cuts of beef, I should have been stoned to death at first thought of such a notion. B- the stew or brew that arrives is delivered in this pressure cooking contraption by one person, cool enough right? But it's all packed up by another person in exactly the same manor it arrived. In my lost potato retrieval efforts I noticed that the bottom of the pot was somewhat burnt or crunchy for lack of better terms, are these pots generally reused? Is my pot of boiling stew someone else's? It just struck me as odd that the bottom of the pot was not smooth as I would expect a clean pot to be. Oh well. 

Finished is by far the greatest. Chocolate and dipping goodies, there literally is no wrong in the world after that! Highly recommended. 

Bottom line is that I will likely only be back for appetizers or dessert. 

However, gleaming quality was the cocktails. By far one of the best Moscow mules I have ever had. So much so I made sure to have two, so refreshing and tasty. 

Final TIP: ladies, keep your hair up, our out or whatever, may hair and clothes smelled of what resembled chicken noodle soup till I showered and though I am not a dirty person or overly OCD about grooming; the thought or pure inconvenience of showering ( and washing your hair) before and after a $150 meal is just annoying and little gross. 

Three stars for pure demand I shower immediately to rid my body of boiled meat smell before I could climb into bed, experience 100% altered by the smell effect.",3,V_5qEY4-1YzO_vI88Tx5WQ

Boiling your own meat is not a good idea anyway you look at it. Seriously who wants their meat boiled? And why do I have to juggle cooking times myself? The cheese course is okay. Dessert is so so. The chocolate seems like it's probably liquid chocolate syrup out of a bottle. Wouldn't you think at a place like this you would be melting from solid chocolate like your do with the cheese?

The bottom line is that for how much you will pay for two 4 course meals you could eat very well at any Steakhouse in the valley where your food is cooked perfectly professionals and the entire experience doesn't take 3 hours.",3,R0e6W9JkqZzAYoml_58uUw

We came for Valentine's Day and plan to return next month for our anniversary. We have NEVER had an experience less than 5 stars before this recent visit (March, 13th 2019) Upon our visit to this location (Ahwatukee) our experience wasn't quite up to the high standards set by this company. We ordered the 4 course experience as usual, as well as cocktails. Our drinks arrived after our cheese was basically finished which seemed odd but as servers ourselves, chose to look past this. We ordered the classic Alpine which is one of our favorite cheese options and unfortunately our server added WAY too much nutmeg and it was not very appetizing. Our main course was great! However we got halfway through the main course and realized we never got our salads. (They later arrived about half way through the main course which at that point we had our meal so it was kind of pointless) We ordered the white chocolate creme brûlée as our final course which is one of our favorites as well and the chocolate did not get flambeed so the caramelization effect it usually has didn't happen which caused the chocolate to have a profoundly sandy texture because there was huge pieces of sugar in it. Like I said before, we are both servers and understand that things happen in the restaurant industry, however we also know that things can be done to accommodate for these types of situations without creating a negative experience. I got the feeling that our server (Reyana) was new so we tried very hard to give her the benefit of the doubt but it was not a good experience at all and when we pay that much for a meal, we want it to meet the previous expectations we have. Even something as simple as removing a $7.00 salad would show that they care that they messed up.

We both love cheese and read up on the reviews prior to coming. This place comes highly recommended by many, after going I don't see why. I made a reservation and selected The Romance Package for 6:00. When we arrived we were promptly seated in a booth that had curtains. The booth was small for me I felt a little cramped being over 6 feet tall. My knees rubbed against the bottom of the table. The server came by and explained how the 4 course meal works with what pairings work well with eachother. Here is where it loses some stars. We were expecting fondue with different cheeses and fixings to go along with it and what you get for cheese is only in the appetizer. It's a small cheese blend with some spices in their melting pot. There wasn't much to it and it didn't get any better from there. After the appetizer the salads came out which we both enjoyed. The next issue was with the entree course. Over the course of the meal after he brought out all the fixings it became very hot in the booth. My date and I started sweating I had to turn down the pot temp and open up the curtain. I'm not sure if this Ahwatukee location has poor AC or the area we were in the corner had sub par ventilation. To make matters worse the booths seating surface was leather so you can imagine it became a very uncomfortable hot mess. The vegetarian entree while it had some good flavors with housemade ravioli and veggie meat balls, also had random vegetables like asparagus and artichoke hearts that did not cook very well in the pot they prepared for us. I wish they had more cheese options other than appetizer for fondues here, sadly they do not. Unfortunately we couldn't stay any longer for the desert fondue due to the ridiculous temperature in the booth. They did send us home with it to go. The bill was as you can imagine expensive for what you receive in return. I can't say I would recommend this place again. Maybe if you decide to check this location out sit in the patio or at the bar with open air flow. It gets hot and stuffy very quickly in the booths.

The pretzels were the biggest hit - but there were very few on the plates. Second course - salads - were just okay.  Definitely premade and refrigerated - not a lot of taste.  Third course - main course.  It was fine, but nothing we would go back for and I think amongst all of us, we tried most things o the menu (vegetarian, fish, steak, chicken).  Last was the dessert course.  Only about half of us even ate dessert.  The chocolate fondue was good, but the desserts for dipping seemed to be premade and refrigerated a cubes pound cake was ice cold.

MP is decent but I'm not super thrilled with it. The first couple times I went (years ago) I got a private booth with a curtain. This last time I just got a table. The ambiance was well, shit compared to the booth. You literally sit there and watch the other tables flail around in trying to cook their food. At least with a booth it is kind of romantic.

The hostest was a robot. When she spoke she was void of emotion. She sounded like she was just playing back a recording. It was super awkward, but whatever.

The four courses - salad, bread/veg, meats, and dessert - are all distinct. Here is the order of greatness - dessert, bread/veg, salad, meats. Honestly for the most expensive part, it is the least worth the money. I tried both the vegetable platter and the all land platter. Imho, veg platter isn't worth it. Meat is partially worth it. I just felt like whatever seasoning there was on the meat...I just washed it off in the broth.

Let me say this - if your dinner sucks, at least get dessert. It is by far the best. Enough that I'd come here JUST for dessert.

Having traveled quite a bit in Spain we are huge fans of tapas and paella. So we went to Tapas Papa Frita with great anticipation for a delicious meal. I am sad to say that this restaurant was a complete letdown for a variety of reasons. 

The restaurant itself is absolutely lovely. I loved the way the place was decorated with representation of Joan Miro's work, since he is one of my all time favorite artists. The restaurant presents itself very nicely. 

We decided to try this restaurant also because their website advertised \"During the month of August...everything on the menu will be buy one and receive the second one at no charge\" for happy hour 5-7pm. Our interpretation of this was that you could buy one item and choose another item for free. The reality was that it was buy one item and get a double portion. This was not clearly worded on their website. 

We sat at the bar and were immediately met with a pretentious attitude form the bar tender which is typical, but unfortunate, in many Scottsdale restaurants. He became more rude when he found out we did not want to order drinks.  This makes no sense to me because the meals cost quite a bit more than drinks would have so it's not like his tip would have suffered. After that he left us to sit for a very long time before taking our order. So long in fact that the manager had to come around to see why our order hadn't been taken. The bartender finally came around after a prompting from his manager and took our order. 

We ordered Txipirones en su Pinto (stuffed squid) and Alcachofa a la Romana (fried artichokes) for our tapas. For dinner we ordered the Paella Valenciana for our entree, to be shared since it was double portion. The fried artichokes arrived on the cool side and the batter was soggy. As I pulled the batter away from one of the artichokes I could taste that it was a marinated artichoke, which was clearly canned or jarred. The appetizer was soggy and unappealing. The stuffed squid arrived and for a \"double portion\" as the happy hour special stated, we received 3 squid. My question is what is the full sized portion? 1.5 squid? The squid was tasty, it was served in what I'm assuming was a blank ink sauce with a spicy tomato sauce on the side. This was the only redeemable part of our meal, it really was quite good. The bread and aioli that was served before the meal was also very good. 

On to the entree, our \"double portion\" of the Paella Valenciana. I should say that we've eaten enough tapas and paella in Spain to where we have a very good idea what to expect from these classic dishes. This was not authentic Spanish paella. First it's impossible that it be truly authentic since it came out in about 15 minutes, traditional paella takes at least 45 minutes to prepare. It was served in a cast iron skillet but it did not have that chewy, crunchy texture that paella has when it's actually finished in the oven. The rice was on the firmer side when it should be mushy and there was a flavorless watery broth whereas true paella should be rich with saffron flavor and the rice should have absorbed any liquid that it was cooked in. The sausage that it was prepared with was tasty but incredibly salty. The chicken was dark meat which I found disappointing. The shellfish was fine, albeit the shrimp were overcooked. Overall I am very sad to say that it was a terrible dish of paella, it was not authentic and not even really worth eating which is why we left a third of it behind. 

Lastly, the restaurant was very warm and the bathrooms appeared to have no air conditioning or the vents were closed. It was 110 degrees today and they had 2 doors right by the bar where we were sitting propped wide open. I understand that it's a new restaurant and they wanted passersby to know that they were open; however, in this day of eco-consciousness, I found this to be an unconscionable waste of energy. Moreover it made the restaurant very warm and uncomfortable. So in my opinion the doors being open resulted in a lose lose situation. 

Thankfully our bill was low due to the \"double portion\" special because I would have been incredibly disgruntled had we paid full price for bad food and bad service. I think Tapas Papa Frita has a nice concept, but they are definitely not ready for prime time.  I can tolerate a pretentious Scottsdale restaurant when the food is dynamite, but this is not the case at Tapas Papa Frita. It's both pretentious and serves bad food. It's a pity because the place is lovely. I hope they pull it together so they can stay in business, but we will not be returning here.

PS* patxi g. who reviewed right below clearly works for this place as he reiterated the same bad wording of the happy hour special and the review seems overly phony.",1,7z9zEQ3EmHLwin9Bii7yVQ

We ate at a different restaurant in Scottsdale, followed by a stroll along the street when we heard some beautiful flamenco music which is what drew us in. We had a few drinks and enjoyed the live flamenco band so much that we ended up making reservations for dinner the very next night. 

Our dinner there was amazing! I had never had tapas before and neither had my family but we loved every bit of it! Their menu is wonderful with a great variety of tapas (small plates), and main courses. The service was outstanding. I forget out waiter's name but he was serving us the night before when we came for drinks and came in the next day on his day off to serve us dinner! The chef even came out towards the end of our meal to talk to us. He explained how most of the ingredients are flown in fresh from Spain. And wow what a difference!

All in all, would definitely recommend this place for couples looking for a lovely date night and groups of friends looking to eat, drink, and be merry!",0,RsIKni1F84wYrdyQQhcFUg

I saw a paella that I really wanted to try (paella diablo), but it is typically a very large portion meant for two people to share.  Unfortunately, my wife isn't all that into spicy food, so I thought I would take a chance and see if they could make me a smaller portion.  My waiter went and asked the chef if they could accommodate that request and the chef was very willing to do so!

The service was good, especially from the owner/manager. He made sure to ask us how everything was and shake our hands when we left which I found really refreshing. The server took a while to bring our check, but we were having such a good time talking it really didn't matter.

The atmosphere was great as well. They had a flamenco dancer there and the ladies and I really enjoyed oogling him over the course of the night. He also would teach you how to dance if you wanted to and dragged the two birthdays in our party up on stage to dance with them. He was definitely a highlight of the night.

The food was absolutely delicious. I had one of their specials for the day, which was basically a seafood chippino with a side of safron rice. If I could have, I would have licked the bowl clean the sauce was so good. The bread and dip they give you at the beginning of the meal are also very good. It's really easy to fill up on them. I tried the eggplant and crab tapas my friend got and they were so good. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food as well.

The only issue I had here was the bathroom. It wasn't stocked and could have been cleaner.

We then asked for water with a plate of lemons and he returns holding two small sticks by a paper towel with two small slices of lemon. Our food was decent but really lacked much taste or flavor.

I happened to spot this place last week when walking around old town last weekend and it looked so lively and I love Spanish food so we made the trip last night. It was fairly busy when we arrived around 915pm and we were created my an older gentlemen in a t shirt and apron.. he was very welcoming and enthusiastic! He sat us on their lovely patio right where we had a perfect view of the flamenco dancers and live guitarist. 

Our waiter took quite a long time to greet us but the busser came out with menus and water. Then our waiter came and got our drink order but kept us waiting a long time. One thing about this place is service is slow and that's how they do it there so expect it. 

While we were waiting the older gentlemen came back to make sure we had ordered or been helped. We explained we hadn't put our order in yet, but was not a big deal since we were watching the show. He then introduced himself as Joseph the owner and head chef! Then the real experience started! He told us about his menu and everything sounded so good so we decided to let him order for us.

Everything was absolutely fantastic! We started with bread and garlic aoli, the garlic shrimp so delicious. As we were waiting Joseph was having a down to earth conversation with us telling us about his family, showing us his kids, telling us about spain and his life there. He was a real delight to speak with and was so humble. He was showing us his garden right next the patio where most of their ingredients from. He grows apples, figs, peppers, tomatos, cauliflower, pumpkin, squash, cilantro, basil, and a lot more stuff I can't remember. He uses no pesticides or chemicals. Now I was impressed and hadn't even eaten but one dish yet! 

Then the waiter started bringing out out the rest of the food, crab stuffed peppers, lamb chops, beef tenderloin, bacon wrapped goat cheese dates, manchego cheese, then paella which was to die for!  Everything was finger licking good! After we finished dinner Joseph came over again and brought us some dessert which was plaintains with pistachio ice cream smothered in liquor 43 which was so good, dessert shots on the house, and even had our wine taken off our bill. I thought this was so nice of him and was completely unexpected! 

In all this place is divine and we were made to feel like family which is above beyond most places. We will definitely be back and will bring our friends and family! This place is a gem and if your looking for an experience this is the place!",1,zMigEyt9TQdAwjtBouTI5w

The hostess was pleasant but our waitress wasn't the friendliest or most helpful.  We were seated inside and the band was playing.  The band was so loud our table couldn't carry on a decent conversation without feeling like we were yelling at each other.   Someone in our party asked for a recommendation and had some questions regarding a menu item.  The waitress  gave a brief description of the item and basically suggested \"it's up to you\" (most of the time when this question is asked, the wait staff usually answers with a \"my favorite on the menu is....).  

At this point we'd had it with the yelling so we asked if a table outside was available.  Luckily, there was, so we moved outside.  It was a little better outside (noise-wise) and the patio has a nice vibe with the lighting and the waterway.

The food was mediocre....nothing special or memorable.

Our second visit was in April 2014.  We thought we'd give this place another chance so we went in for an after dinner drink.  Again, the hostess was pleasant and we asked to be seated outside since we knew it would be loud inside and the band was already playing.  We were seated at the same table as before.

Our waiter, Jorge P., was unbelievably rude from the start.  My girlfriend asked if the restaurant had any cocktail specialties.  In a tone that sounded like he was being put out, he basically pointed to the menu and rattled off the names of common cocktails on the menu.  When my girlfriend ordered a vodka (Stoli) and grapefruit, he SNAPPED, \"This isn't a nightclub.....we don't carry Stoli !!\".  He said \"Grey Goose and grapefruit\" (of course the most expensive vodka) in a \"that's it--I'm ordering for you\" tone.   When my husband ordered 2 white wines, he answered in an annoyed voice, \"Why don't you make my life easier and just order the bottle?\".   He tried to up-sell each one of us.

The only reason they got 2 stars was because the hostess was decent to us both times, the food was mediocre and the outside patio is nice.

I personally have lived for years in Scottsdale, and we wanted to offer our guests a nice dinner, assuming it would be a memorable night, and so it was!! We saw the menu and the prices were reasonable. The waiter Eduardo; he recommended us the special which seemed perfect, the special included tapas and paella for the value of $ 45.00; which he mentioned is was ideal to share since we were a group. We decided to order 2 SPECIALS, for drinks sangria's, 1 coke, 2 glasses of wine and water. Eduardo never showed us in writing this so called SPECIAL; we were told did not appear in the menu. When he brought us the food we got TWO PAELLAS AND TAPAS, ( I have pictures) seem to us was exactly what we order, TWO SPECIALS.
After we finish eating, we asked for the bill to be divided into 2, one of them was for $ 272.44 and the second for a total of $ 202.06; in total we were charged for 474.50. We believed there was a mistake and asked to speak to the waiter, he went to the kitchen and some man came out claiming to be the owner, started laughing sarcastically when we tried to explain the situation, embarrassing everyone at our table, saying we were drunk, and that we were lairs. This man was arrogant and offensive, accusing us of wanting to take advantage of not paying our bill. We decided to call the police. When he saw us dialing he called the police as well. When the police arrived my niece and I explained the situation and what we were being charged; our explanations were not heard and we were forced under pressure to pay such erroneous bill. My recommendation for tourists and residents is ORDER FROM THE MENU, STAY AWAY FORM THE SPECIALS!! PLEASE SEE WE HAVE NOT BEEN THE ONLY ONES, THERE ARE OTHER REVIEWS WITH THE SAME OR VERY SIMILAR EXPERIENCE RELATED TO THE SPECIALS!

After all we went through, some of us had to create accounts in YELP to be able to post our reviews and let other people know of our experience, well, the owner or whoever is Nanette G. has replied to some of them, even to ones that are not even us, or related to us, accusing them and us to be lying, that the reviews are false. Mentioning that we struggle to pay our bill, that we had planned since the beginning to skip our bill, that the restaurant called the police first, and so on... who cares who called first, we both called the police; and I answer directly to you Nanette G. of course we struggle to pay our bill, we were not planning on spending almost $500 dollars on food, we never order 7 SPECIALS. Since this is not the first time this restaurant has had this problem, I believe you Nanette G. should approach this issue in a professional way, and not making matters worse, blaming everyone else and not taking responsibility for your staff mistakes, Shame on you!",2,1b0OPCVUbp4bfRHXe3TM6w

Goat cheese-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates: One of my favorites. It's a little on the sweeter side but the spectrum of flavor in a bite will knock you off your feet.

Crab-stuffed peppers: Also a favorite; it is a pepper stuffed with pimiento cheese and crab served over a saffron sauce, I believe. I would have ordered more of these if I could.

Manchego Cheese: It was just manchego cheese in an oil (maybe rosemary?) Not that impressive

Spicy Garlic Shrimp: Get this. Just do it. 

Pork Tenderloin: Whatever sauce came on top of this is delicious. And the pork was cooked perfectly.

Adobo Beef: Also good, but just tastes like any other adobo beef.

Paella Valencia: This paella had mussels, clams, shrimp, chicken, peppers, onions and more. The flavors married well! If it's your first paella, get this one. I think I'll try the lobster and shrimp paella next time.

I was hoping for a romantic spot on the patio since it was nice outside and we'd beat the crowd with our 5:30pm reservation. Inside the restaurant was pretty bare so unfortunately we were given an awkward table in the back, facing the bar and near the kitchen...probably to give the inside servers something to do...even though I'd put \"Anniversary Dinner :)\" on our OpenTable reservation/note to the restaurant. I wouldn't have minded this so much since we were isolated from everyone else, but another couple was seated directly behind us, about 3 feet away so it was just plain awkward. 

Our server Vincent was actually pretty amazing. My water was never empty and he even went out of his way to ask the chef if we could order an item from the Restaurant Week menu (since we'd strayed onto the regular menu for the paella). We ordered two items from the tapas menu - crab stuffed peppers and the patatas w/ aioli, plus the bacon wrapped dates (RW menu item), and all three were awesome. I ordered the steak + bleu cheese and my SO ordered the diablo paella. The steak was cooked perfectly but the paella was lacking some serious spice considering the title, albeit delicious and well seasoned. I also ordered the sangria, which I thought was great (and even ate the fruit). Overall we left the restaurant stuffed and pleased with our anniversary date location decision. 

And now my reasoning for the poor rating. Several hours after leaving TPF I started to get a stomach ache that, at first, felt like my stomach just wasn't agreeing with all of that food I ate, but then turned into something sinister. I'll spare you the gory details but will say that this was definitely food poisoning. Fever, nausea, the whole nine yards.

The biggest draw for me was the seemingly endless count of Tapas, at least a dozen in each category: Seafood, Meat, Vegetables/Cheese.  I always get a kick from trying to visualize what fun flavors can be produced from these \"exotic\" ingredients.

In my humble book, I tend to base my Spanish experience on one dish and one dish only and that is the glorious Paella!  For me, this is a deal breaker!  The pricing was fair and reasonable, but the quality fell quite short! The classic Valencia was simply, too watery! History tells me it should be fluffier, creamier and rich in flavor! On the other hand, the Arros Negre, was more pleasing and entertaining! If you never had squid ink in the paella form, it is a safe try!  The only caveat is it temporarily leaves black marks around your lips, teeth, and tongue.

The list of Tapas we tried included: 
** the best and recommended

- The Spanish Potato Pie: was not as soft and fluffy as I imagined, parts of it were choppy, mediocre taste.

- Mushrooms with Garlic and Sherry: very average, nothing too special here.

** Rabbit Stew with Bread Sauce: for the first time trying this, it was actually pretty good, tasted like Chicken!  the meat was tender with a rich flavored stew!

** Braised Oxtail in Paprika Sauce: pleasantly pulled off the bone good!

- Lamb Chops: thought it was somewhat dry, thus not as juicy as I had hoped for.  2 or 3 pieces, I believe.

- Calamari Rings: the batter was light and cooked perfectly, accompanied by three different sauces, that I cannot recall the names to, but nonetheless, tasty.

- Snails: average, nothing to spectacular.

The pitcher of Sangria was too small for my usual liking, it filled just 4 small glasses and lacked the wine taste.

What I liked the most was the atmosphere--live music created a fun mood and the rich detail of the Spanish-esque decor to bring everything together.

Since I was here for my birthday, they did bring out a complimentary flan that I thought tasted a little eggy? The cool part was partaking in a Spanish tradition where the server shoots a long stream of wine into your mouth. 
 
Overall, the experience here was just average with mediocre flavors among the Tapas with some exceptions, thus, I would only return for the Squid Ink Paella, Rabbit Stew, and Braised Oxtail.",6,8DGFWco9VeBAxjqsuh1aSw

-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ,3,2010-08-21 23:23:18,2,tiMOibh6xvIuD8Y9eUpmeA,3.0,"Decent if you're jonesing for tapas. (This is not a paella review. Yet.) I apologize in  advance if this comes off as one of those reviews that makes managers and PR firms cringe. I know you can't do authentic tapas in Southbridge/Waterfront and stay open. But I have to rate it honestly, or not at all.

I remember the original TPF on Camelback, I think where Sportsmans or Tarbell's is now. I recall it being exotic and delicious, with the right intimate atmosphere. My memory could be clouded by lack of experience at the time. But overall, *this* place is a little too big, clean and corporatey to match an authentic tapas experience like you'd get in Barcelona, or Basque Spain, or some of the real deal places like in NYC. I don't think you can be located where they are and pull that off. So it's dumbed down a bit for the market. I think if you're not on the search for a super authentic, intimate experience (small bar, communal tables, etc) it will fit the bill.


ATMOSPHERE
Big, open, lively and trying a little too hard, IMHO. The uniforms look like Halloween costumes. It comes off a bit too kitschy. Staff all seemed pretty friendly, if a little harried. The live music is a nice touch, even though pretty low energy when we were there. I'm anxious to catch some Flamenco though.


SERVICE
Our server, Timo, was the epitome of charm and enthusiasm. Big thumbs up for him. But timing was all over the place. First round of drinks took  f-o-r-e-v-e-r. We saw other tables clearly looking around for their servers. Not sure if the bar is the hold-up or what. Food took much longer than expected as well, since we didn't order paella or anything that was likely made to order. Once the food started coming, we got it all pretty quickly.


DRINKS
Man. Do not order the mojitos. I admit I'm pretty picky about them. I love making them at home. I want them muddled fresh and I want to taste all the ingredients. They have a \"pitcher approach\". It's like they have mojitos on tap. I asked for a fresh mojito, not a whole pitcher. I just wanted to try their mojito, and then move on to an Albariño or some other wine. I got the pitcher anyway. And what came out was refreshing alright. Much like ice water is refreshing. Basically clear liquid with some rum aftertaste. No detectable lime. One sad little shred of mint in each pour. Very little sugar. The pitcher approach works well for sangria, obviously. But do not do this for mojitos. Doesn't do them justice. My wife's red wine choice (a pintoresco by the glass) was very good. A friend who tracked us down there after a Yelp check-in said the sangria was very good. So there you go.


FOOD
I'll point out the stand-outs:

Boquerones
Fresh white anchovies in light oil. Delicious. Smaller than I've had elsewhere. A little more body to the fillet is nice. But a great light dish.

Rabbit Stew
This one gets you bang for the buck, if you're not averse to eating cute little bunny rabbits. Lots of tender delicious sweet meat in a light tomato broth with a nice acid too it. Bone-in meat ensured lots of flavor.

Shrimp a la Plancha (or whatever they called it)
Head-on, shell-on shrimp. Messy to eat unless you crunch the whole shell. Not quite crispy enough to allow for that though. So mostly we peeled them. Quality white shrimp with real shrimp flavor. Not the rubber you so often get with grilled shrimp.

Oxtail Stew
This should be so up my alley. Classic mirepoix dark stew flavor. Did I detect a little store-bought demi-glace starter? But it could have been braised a bit longer. Like a couple more hours. There was still too much un-rendered fat and connective stuff; not enough meat.

Basque Sausage
Not memorable. If you've ever gotten the Spanish Chorizo from Schreiner's, or LaTienda.com, you'll know what I wish it was like. When we get the Schreiner's, it never makes it through the car ride home.

Mix of Snails, Sausage and something else
Didn't do it for us. No individual character to each of the proteins. Just a mash-up of savory chewy bits. Be a pretty good starter bread dip if you were hungry, but not a great dish.

Pan con Tomate (pan boli?)
For me, this is a benchmark item. This would have been better if the bread had more chewiness and structure to it.

And of course they have all the stand-bys like Potatas Bravas, Fried Squid, etc. And Paella. Next time, I'm trying the Valenciana for sure. That alone could add a star if the flavors are there. But there better be smokiness, bone-in dark meat chicken and the rice better be crispy on the bottom of the pan.


So, just A-OK for now.

I could see an updated 4 star review once...
 a) I've further explored the menu and know what all the gems are, and learn what to avoid, for my taste.

 b) they fine-tune the service and hopefully work on the authenticity. the crowd that was there and the location don't give me much hope for tuning toward the more authentic. if anything, i fear it being dumbed down even more.",6,axGqLJ9UWb7P4sBXafOeeA
-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ,3,2015-09-11 19:49:51,1,HvZKZ0XC0eOXCAF1PnLZVQ,5.0,"Although having vaguely heard of Tapas Papa Fritas, and a connoisseur of excellent Spanish Cuisine - I didn't pay much attention to this eatery, I am very astonished to say, because of its name - Fried Potato Snacks!  Boy was I wrong!  Being of Spanish heritage, I was flabbergasted with Tapas Papa Fritas' traditional atmosphere, an atmosphere emitting Basque, Andalusian, Moorish, Castilian and Asturian regions feel, décor and food!  This appealing and large eatery smacks of being in Spain!  From being almost obscure in its external surroundings, once you step up the path to the front door, past the traditional-style plant-filled veranda, see their fabulous outdoor seating area, you have arrived to the old world of España!  Having grown up in a Spanish-Cuban atmosphere, I am well versed in the fare offerings, what I should anticipate both traditionally and in any nouveau prospects.  I was impressed and satisfied!  While absorbing the atmosphere, we were seated near a window whereby we had the opportunity to admire both the inside and outside, as we experienced a fine bottle of Pinetti Notte Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie 2014.  My wife and I were pleased to see some of the old-world as well as fine-dining traditions followed by our Server, Sina who showed his expertise in not only fine proper serving, but old-world rapport, pleasantry and knowledge.  Elegant service from table cloths, silverware and the use of an enoteca for wine.  As newcomers to the establishment, we decided to try something that would give us the widest array of samplings, so we started with their Tapas Deluxe Special which included: Gambas al Pil-Pil, Chorizo, Txistorra, Stuffed Dates, Queso Manchego, Chicken Skewer, and a Lamb Shank - all prepared and served to perfection.  And, just as is in the Old World, no rush... patience, enjoyment and privacy abound.  We then went for the main course.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed (I did too) her serving of Paella Valenciana in a traditional style with saffron rice, fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, tender chicken, extraordinary txistorra, peppers, onions, tomatoes and peas - beyond delectable it was!  I proceeded to have their incredible rendition of Conejo (Rabbit) Romescu Catalan-style, with a soft to the palate peppery tomato almond sauce over an excellent rendition of traditional saffron rice.  If you enjoy rabbit as I do, this dish is for you - amazing!  I believe it needless to say, by the end of our meal, we had no room for dessert of which they have a wonderful assortment of Spanish selections.  It is no wonder why this eatery has received the accolades it has on media, from critics and awards alike -the food, the atmosphere, the staff, the accoutrements and the vibe are magnificent.  Our profound kudos to Chef Joseph Gutierrez and his incredible art.  As unfortunately so many 'Traditional' Spanish in the Valley and across the country tend to do, sway to changing the great things which don't need changing from our past - the only nouveau here is the first time patron.  We look forward to visiting them as frequently as possible to get our taste buds wrapped around more of their fabulously authentic cuisine, Flamenco shows and live Latin music during the weekends.  Can't wait for the next visit.  Excellent ambience, service, hospitality and food - next time I'm going for my favorite: Zarzuela (Seafood Stew - some may know it as Spanish-style Bouillabaisse)!  Bon appétit!",5,r_Q6zhem0pJhvLcvp3YTXw
-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ,20,2015-07-03 19:03:33,17,LmqY9v-GMHb5YqyFaYC6cg,3.0,"Well nothing takes you back to Spain like getting on an aeroplane and flying there when the finances are right. But here in Phoenix, if you can settle for watered down sangria for $8 a glass, no bullfight, and no cigarette smoke then dining at Tapas Papa Frita is recommended. On weekends you can enjoy entertainment with dinner.

The menu is large and heavy and of a reddish background color, so it was a bit annoying to read through. But of course being from the Yelp community I pre-read it online and already had an idea of what I would get. Go figure I was asking everybody else if they were ready to order yet.

Other reviewers have complained about the lack of service. That wasn't my experience. In fact I feel like we were over served. I had to give our waitress the evil eye for popping over every two seconds while we perused the menu. And at meals end she insisted on taking our leftovers to wrap them herself instead of bringing containers to the table.

There were several selections of vegetarian tapas. Few were vegan, some prepared with cheese or type of crema, one had ham (which I'm unsure why it would be listed in the vegetable section). 

Having tapas is kind of like building your own tasting menu, and we didn't hold back. Here are the uniquely tasty morsels we tried. 

1. Pastel a la Porrusalda: Leek tart in a pastry - 6.50
Liked it, but the dough was a bit chewy

2. Champiñones al Jerez: Braised mushrooms with garlic and sherry - 6.50
Liked it, but not too flavorful

3. Pimientos a la Riojana: roasted peppers with olive oil - 7.50
Liked.

4. Patatas Bravas: Spicy red potato wedges - 4.95 
Liked them, but they had crema on top and were not spicy at all.

5. Tortilla de Patatas: Spanish potato pie - 4.50
Liked, but it was dry.

6. Escalivalda: Peppers, onions, eggplant, tomatoes, garlic over bread - 7.00 
The veggies were good, but had a tangy taste.
Did not like the bread, it was hard and not garlicky.

7. Cabrales con Menbrillo: Cabrales cheese with quince - 9.00
So-so

8. Setas con Queso De Cabra: Stuffed portabello with goat cheese - 9.00
Recommended by the waitress. Liked it, but it was too small. 
I expected a burger sized mushroom, but it was about a third of what I expected.

9. Pollo al Ajillo: roasted chicken thigh in lemon garlic - 7.00

Having gone through the basket of white bread rolls and aioli and all these tapas, we were getting full. But entrees were coming. 

1. Pollo con Jamon: Ham and cheese wrapped chicken breast with capers, and guindilla sauce - 16.00

2. Paella de Vegetales: Seasonal garden vegetables with saffron rice - 16.95 

Although the paella was tasty I would not order it again. As a rice dish with cooked veggies the whole thing just had a mushy consistency to me. One spoonful was more than enough.

And now for the sweetest ending. No spanish dinner is complete without some churros. But share one dessert? Not at my table! So we also ordered the Pastel de Pan: banana and apple bread pudding with ice cream - 6.00 

There's no point in saying another word about the bread pudding. If you like bread pudding then try it. 

Cut to the churros. Oh dessert heaven...the churros! Churrrrrrrrros. I felt like dancing around the restaurant stomping my heels like a flamenco dancer and instead of clacking castanets, I would have churros on my fingers.
 
Churros con Chocolate - 7.00
Served warm, stuffed with hazelnut/caramel filling (??) and with a side of chocolate. 
Unfortunately they were coated in a lot of unnecessary sugar, but delicious just the same.",18,X5T45QxyLjnuXohkvE3Rfw

Don't ask questions, unless you really want to hear the answer. But, his enthusiasm was infectious and cute. Even better, he was a great server in the way he was friendly, attentive, respectful and charming. Nicely done. He had us laughing most of the evening, which was a welcome relief from the woes of Monday.

My friend and I hit this place up for their happy hour. I hadn't been in a while, so it was a no-brainer. Zen 32 is a sure-bet to me. I'm always going to find something on the menu I like, and I'm usually going to walk away very satisfied. It's not the most amazing sushi i've had, but it's predictable in the sense that it'll hit the spot every single time, no matter what I choose to try.

I ordered the salmon sashimi, veggie roll and yellow tail w/ scallion roll. They were very, very good. The yellowtail w/ scallion is a new fave. For sure. To wash it down, I had their Belgian White Ale. Tasty. 

I gotta say, their happy hour prices are incredible. $3 per roll or sashimi order; $2 edamama; $1 off draft beer. I'm pleased to say I can come here and stuff my face without emptying my bank account. Plus, the HH menu is pretty diverse, too. From spicy to simple, you got options. 

So, Zen 32, you're still a top favorite of mine. Anytime anyone suggests coming here, the answer is simple: yes! Their service, selection and sushi are tried-and-true. And that's all that matters to me. Mmmm.",1,KeuwC8E1238SP6xyKpBM6w

Waters came quickly but we had to wave someone down to take our order after sitting there with the menus closed for 10 minutes. The server had said he'd be right back to take orders when he brought out the water.

Service: Poor, pretty much non existent after taking our initial order. No check ups or anything after waiting over 30 minutes for the food to come out. My water cup was empty and they did not bring water until after the food arrived. I could've used a refill during the lull. The servers don't have specific sections so we were receiving overlapping service.

Food: Ordered the Agedashi Tofu and it was bad. Instead of the traditional thin layer of crispy starch, it was deep fried in tempura batter. The ramen Miso and Garlic Oil ramen were decently portioned for the price. I like that they include half an egg and spice for no additional charge. The egg however, is not seasoned and just plain boiled.

Pros: A wide selection of 85% authentic Ramen. They have Sapporo on Draft and even a variety of flavored Soju (Korean...but delicious)...Takoyaki. When ordering \"spicy\", the level of spice is admirable considering the typically bland US palet for anything other than salt and pepper. Bravo. 

Cons: The chef should be ashamed at his attempt at Tako Yaki. I should lower my expectations when ordering a Japanese street food in a brick and mortar restaurant, but omitting the Katsuobushi is a mortal sin. 

Sapporo is nice, but Asahi on draft is non-negotiable.

I don't know what those other people ate but the chicken ramen we had was quite possibly the worst food I've ever had in a restaurant.  Specifically, the soup base was so salty that after one or two spoonsful I couldn't take it any more.  Since I'd paid good money for this, I felt I should at least eat the solid stuff.  After a bottle and a half of water to wash it down, I finished the solid stuff and then went home and drank some orange juice to get the salt taste out of my mouth.  Speaking of the solid stuff, what my $8.95 bought was two slices of chicken breast 1/8\" thick, half a boiled egg and some noodles.  They must get about six bowls of soup out of each chicken breast.  With so little content, even if this soup had been delicious, I would have been better off to go to Teriyaki Madness nearby for a MUCH better value.

First of all, the wait was a little too long. I've been to other, smaller ramen places in town and the turnover is a lot quicker. I think it's because the staff is quick at table service. Ichi had maybe 5 staff in the front and 3 or 4 in the kitchen. I've seen a smaller place get more customers through in a timely manner with 2 or 3 front and 3 in the back. Turning over and getting people seated is all in the front of house. Quickly meeting the needs of the seated customers. 
As far as the food, i personally liked the ramen. I had the black garlic and it was tasty, probably could've used better quality noodles. My friend had the classic tonkotsu and she enjoyed it.
Side dishes were a miss, we did the combos which gave us a full sized ramen, green salad, and an appetizer of choice. I had the gyoza and she had the fried rice. The gyoza seemed frozen, store bought. The fried rice looked like it was going to be delicious, but it was a little bland. I also had an order of the takoyaki, which i thought was pleasantly yummy.

I should've re-evaluated my choice to order the tomato broth seafood ramen when most Ramen places are known for their Tonkatsu, but I wanted to have something a little lighter for lunch. I also ordered their tempura appetizer which was a shrimp/ veggie combo. So... the ramen. It came looking like a jumble of noodles and vague ingredients in a liquid that smelled and looked very startlingly like Campbell's tomato soup. It wasn't  nicely laid out with ingredients on top, and I could see chunks of raw onion, which I don't like, and was not listed on the ingredients, swimming in this thick liquid. I poked into it, and a sweet-tomato-seafood smell wafted up. I don't know what I was expecting, but the sweet, super salty, almost ketchupy taste was not it. The ingredients were spare, but I just couldn't get over the broth. To make things worth, I had ordered extra broth like I usually do at ramen houses and I was completely enveloped in this sweet salty tomato soup smell and could've saved myself the extra dollar. The tempura didn't fare any better- no light crisp coating here, it was heavily encased- almost like a thick beer batter, and the shrimp were tiny- the vegetables a joke (one of them was a heavily battered single green bean, which slid in soggy fashion out of its batter casing when I bit into it) and to add insult to injury, the tempura sauce was super salty as well. My 2 stars are only for the cleanliness, decent service, and texture of the noodles, which were decently springy and chewy even being the thin style of ramen noodles. Given we don't have ramen options at all in the north, in sheer desperation I may come back to try the regular tonkatsu broth / meat options, but take my word for it- steer clear of the seafood option and the tempura.

Well- my stars aren't changing... (brrr). I was very hungry and ordered the black garlic ramen based on other reviews here and their \"chicken\" karaage. I quote \"chicken\" because I surmise there MAY have been a scrap or two of flesh somewhere in the small pile of over-fried, greasy, thick, unsalted, tasteless clumps. They were crisp and then as you got to the center oil flavor just kept coming. I even bit experimentally into 1-2 of the larger pieces looking for meat, and only saw thick, oil-soaked batter. Got queasy. Decided to move on to the soup, which incidentally, they served to me a good 5 minutes before the appetizer, with no utensils (someone else, not my waiter, noticed I was sitting there with a bowl of hot ramen and no chopsticks and did bring a pair over with an embarrassed chuckle). First thing- the entire surface of the broth was encased in oil. I've had delicious, deeply flavorsome black garlic ramen at other places in town and it's always garlic oil DROPS floating on the surface, with fried garlic slices. This was a veritable layer of oil on top and the fried garlic and shallots? onions? in the broth were exceedingly bitter. The brother had decent flavor but tasted weak, like it was watered down. As I was sitting at the bar trying to eat, my neighbor to the right, a lady, kept exclaiming to her dining partner that her broth was \"so salty, way too salty, yes, too salty for my taste\" and finally pushed it away. My final disappointment was the noodles. They weren't the same as the ramen noodles served last time, which was the one redeeming quality of the horrible seafood ramen I ordered last visit and a point of positivity that I was looking forward to. They were white, and looked and felt like thinner rice noodles, definitely over boiled with none of the fresh bounce and chew and yellow color that I noticed last time. All in all, to say I regret spending $18 here (yes, I tipped the waiter $2 though he never checked on me once after he took my order) is an understatement and I definitely won't be back. Save your money for gas and drive to Chinatown- Ramen Sora, Monta, or even Sapporo Revolving Sushi which unexpectedly has the best black garlic broth I have tasted recently.

............

This was literally one of the worst meals I have had in a while. I should've re-evaluated my choice to order the tomato broth seafood ramen when most Ramen places are known for their Tonkatsu, but I wanted to have something a little lighter for lunch. I also ordered their tempura appetizer which was a shrimp/ veggie combo. So... the ramen. It came looking like a jumble of noodles and vague ingredients in a liquid that smelled and looked very startlingly like Campbell's tomatoes soup. Not nicely laid out with ingredients on top, and I could see chunks of raw onion, which was not listed on the ingredients. I poked into it, and a sweet-tomato-seafood smell wafted up. I don't know what I was expecting, but the sweet, super salty, almost ketchupy taste was not it. The ingredients were spare, but I just couldn't get over the broth. To make things worth, I had ordered extra broth like I usually do and I was completely enveloped in this sweet salty tomato soup smell. The tempura didn't fare any better- no light crispy batter here, it was heavily battered, almost like a thick beer batter, and the shrimp were tiny- the vegetables a joke (one of them was a heavily battered single green bean) and to add insult to injury, the tempura sauce was super salty as well. My 2 stars are only for the cleanliness, decent service, and texture of the noodles, which were decently springy and chewy even being the thin style of ramen noodleGiven we don't have ramen options at all in the north, in sheer desperation I may come back to try the regular tonkatsu broth / meat options, but take my word for it- steer clear of the seafood option and the tempura!",0,lFcmHJTpCXLY_RtMQHS1BQ

On the first visit, the Miso Ramen's chashu was perfect, tender and flavorful.  Yesterday's visit when I had the Creamy Tonkotsu Ramen, the chashu was thin and tough, so that was disappointing.

I tried the Curry Ramen this visit along with edamame app. The broth was thick and creamy with delicious curry flavor that was enhanced as the the bottom of the bowl came near. The noodles are accompanied by chopped scallions, corn and a pan fried chicken breast sliced into 1\" strips.  The dish was served with a generous portion of noodles which I swear we're tied to the bottom of the bowl because I struggled to get them into my mouth. Or maybe I just suck at using chopsticks. I really enjoyed this bowl of curry broth goodness.

Edamame was typical of what you would expect anywhere. No sense in trying to get creative in the explaination, keep it simple like this dish with just a hint of sea salt.

The picture and description of the bouquet was very specific on the website, so I was sad and disappointed when my friend sent me the picture of the bouquet that arrived. First, it was not as full and pretty as the picture, the daisies were wilted, and we couldn't find the lilies that were supposed to be in it. I called the shop to complain and the daughter of the owner called her mom to tell her she didn't put lilies in the bouquet (I overheard the conversation). The mother called me back and said she had included them and tried to say I didn't know what lilies were (I realize these aren't supposed to be stargazers). So my friend looked closer and we saw there were little green wilted things that didn't look like lilies at all. I told the owner (politely too) that this bouquet looked like a cheap grocery store one. Plus, I purchased the step up from the original bouquet on the website. She said that was offensive to her...to HER. She said if I'm really upset, she can send more flowers tomorrow. Unfortunately, my friends wedding shower is today and I even posted a screenshot of my email receipt to show that the wilted flowers in the picture are from the same day of delivery (not days later). The owner said she stands by her product so I told her the pictures could stand for her product too then. All together I spent $70 on what was maybe the equivalent of a $20 bouquet from the grocery store. The flowers were unhealthy and I'm sad that my friend didn't get to have a nice bouquet on her special day. Super disappointed that the owner wouldn't help me out by at least replacing the bouquet today or just admitting she didn't have fresh flowers to deliver on this order so that I could buy nice ones from another shop.

3- Way over priced drinks!! Krave your not on the strip anymore! One bar charge us $5 more than the other bar- what!! Unacceptable!
4- Poor go- go dancing have really low lighting on them and not Involved with the customers in anyway! How do they make money here? No cute dancers here, got to go to share or piranha for them to be hot and up in your face! 
5- The dance floor empty out by 1:45a!!!! A club clearing out that early hmmm maybe everyone ran out of money for the high drinks and had to get on the road back to nice part of town? Or probably went to share which I saw most people there when I arrived at 2:15a.
6- If you leave and want to walk around on Fremont street- be very aware it's Definitely not gay friendly and you'll probably get robbed that late at night!

Tall prices, short cans. Great name for a brewery, middle of the line beer.

Tried their experimental beer at Cask Days and decided to visit the brewery. Sampled some ambitious variants including the Ochame green tea IPA, Nanatsu no tazai imperial coffee lager, and the Sora dry hopped saison. With interesting ingredients (for the beer world), I was excited to try but these fell flat. 

If you get a chance to try their Koji flavored beers at Cask Days, give it a try, but these selected cans didn't live up to it.

 I had the double meat plate for $11.99 (Plus $1 up charge for some meats) which seemed to be the best deal on the menu. I tried pulled pork and wings, with sides of green beans and creamy coleslaw. The plate also came with a tiny cornbread and cinnamon butter. It was great to have plenty of BBQ sauce available near the drink station, but none of the sauces were good. The sauces, ok, I didn't care for them but that could be a personal preference. The chicken wings were good. They didn't taste smoked, but they had a salty dry rub that was tasty. The pulled pork was the biggest disappointment on the platter. It was mostly burnt ends that were too tough to chew, and shaved up pieces of pork mixed with fat - there were no solid chunks of tender pulled pork like you get at real southern BBQ places. So, maybe it was an off- day for the pork. But I tried the turkey and brisket off my family's plates and both were tough and the turkey was way too salty. The brisket was half fat and the rest rubber. 

The side dishes were okay at best. Creamy coleslaw was good. Green beans were WAY too artificially green. They were almost neon green! Something wasn't right. The Mac and Cheese was tasty. 

Since there isn't really much BBQ competition in Cleveland, sadly this may be one of the only places to get it if you're craving it. I will wait until I'm back in the south to have  any more BBQ.",2,iipaDtoA1zHFkbAF3Gn5Rg

There were fresh hush puppies on it which were the perfect substitution for croutons!  Mom's sides were coleslaw (creamy) and baked beans.  I enjoyed the beans.  I'm not a creamy coleslaw chick but ma appeared to like it. There are approximately 4 different BBQ sauces to choose from; from spicy to sweeter.  All were good.  

You order at the counter & they bring the food to your table.  Old Carolina BBQ is great for either dine-in or take-out.  They cater too.  In fact, I think I may be ordering from them in the future for a catered event.

Ordering from the Super Secret Menu makes for a decent burger (whole grilled onion slice is key), but they never read that it's impossible to cook good fries by frying the potato once. Lame, limp, and tasteless. Even ordering well done fries just makes sure they're not cold when you're done with the burger.

At a place where they hype the freshness of the ingredients, the milkshakes are on tap from a machine.

If you're from California, chances are that you OMG TOTALLY LOVE THIS PLACE. Put an In and Out Burger in the Midwest and you'll see it die a quick death because they're just NOT that good.

Lucinda and I walked in just after they opened so it wasn't busy.  I wanted to glance at the menu for a moment but they were in a tremendous hurry for us to place our order.

Better know what you want in advance or stand back so they can't corral you into placing your order.  If you step up to read the menu they'll pounce.

Large fries.

We only have one size, do you want more than one?

Well, how big is it?  

Shouting in a very grating voice, the order taker repeated:  We only have one size, do you want more than one? 

She's very impatient, demanding an immediate answer.  I wanted to tell her:  Take a breath.  It's not busy yet.  Just relax and let us place our order. Allow me to ask a fucking question about the fries.

\"I understand the concept of just one one size and I'm not hard of hearing.\"  She didn't respond. If a customer expresses displeasure just act like you didn't hear it. Since there is no way to gauge how many fries are in an order, we asked for two servings. 

One order is plenty, it turns out.  The fries were limp and saturated with stale grease.

I asked for my double double with grilled onions.  The burgers came with no indication which had onions.  No onions.  Some fast food eateries will put a mark on the wrapping to let you know it has onions.  At In N Out it's part of the secret menu.  Whether you actually get onions when you want them is their secret.

Everyone shouts here.  Very loud, hectic, and annoying.  Very unpleasant.  They're all hurry hurry, hurry hurry.  I could understand if it were busy but the store was practically empty.

The burgers are just fair, no better than Burger King or Carl's Jr.  The \"cheese\" is not actual cheese but a glue-like product that sticks to your teeth & gums. 

You want bacon?  Forget bacon.  In N Out's secret of success is very limited choices.  And if they don't feel like it, you won't get one of the few choices they offer.

Been there twice, one visit worse than another.

First time, they made us wait, though barely three tables were occupied in the whole place. The food was ok - nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain. Price tag was not really high, so I don't think that $$$ is entirely correct.

Second time, not only we've been waiting till another two tables, arriving after us, were served, but the food was simply not fresh - teriyaki beef barely warmed up in a microwave, mashed potato cold, and the whole lunch box was just from the fridge. This food was NOT prepared fresh - flat chinatown-quality stuff.

On the positive side, waitresses were always smiling, but missing to fill our cups with tea or respond fast - and, again, the room was never packed - just a couple of tables, so don't know what made them so busy as to be inattentive.

Resuming:

- Average to low quality food;
- Consistently long waiting times;
- Polite, but not helpful staff.

The first comes with either chicken or beef teriyaki, a small salad with a house dressing, 4 California rolls, 3 tuna rolls, edamame beans and tempura.

I wasn't overly impressed with the rolls I got. The \"spicy\" salmon roll wasn't spicy whatsoever and it made me think whether they even got the right order. I ate it anyway because it still tasted fine. The 2nd roll I got was supposedly a crunchy roll, as they had tempura bits in it, but the tempura bits were just overly soggy and not appetizing at all. I didn't even want to finish it because it was just the wrong texture all around. The sashimi tasted at least fresh so I didn't complain there. The gyoza and teriyaki chicken that they forgot initially felt like they simply heated up the chicken and slopped on some sauce and threw together the gyoza as they prepared in like 2 min.

The large arcade has all kinds of different fun games for kids, including skiball and other games which rewards players with redeemable tickets for toys at the end.

The Good:  the staff is friendly.  They seem to employee younger folks, and they have always been polite and helpful.  It's always been hectic and busy on my visits and the staff keeps up with the work.  They seems to have invested a lot into the technology of the bowling lanes.  Tons of nice new screens, terminals, and the like (although ours was giving us issues last night and we had to reset a few times, taking away from our bowling time which is a by the hour rate.).  If you have a group of 5 you can split the cost and it's quite affordable.

The Bad.  FOOD.  This place is ridiculous when it comes to food prices.  Last night I ordered chicken tenders (I got 4 small pieces), a piece of pizza, order of fries and 2 fountain sodas...came to $21.  These are frozen, throw in the deep fryer, fast food type items.  To make matters worse, as the cashier was ringing up my items I noticed they were coming up at different prices that what are listed on their menu (it's a giant screen, digital-can be updated easily).  My chicken tenders were listed at 6.99..rang up at 7.99.  2.75 pizza, rang up $3, and so on.  $4 bottles of domestic beer, $3 drafts...this isn't an upscale craft brew artisan dining establishment, I have no idea what they are thinking.

I can't imagine taking a group of children here for a family outing, it would be well over a hundred dollars to bowl and feed a family of 4 and bowl for 2 hours.

*4/6/16-I should mention that I didn't bring the error in pricing to the attention of the cashier at my time of purchase.  He seemed a bit busy, and appeared to be 16(ish), I didn't want to further burden him having to get his manager or add to to his tasks.  I just wanted my food to be prepared (he had to ring it up and then go make it).  I should have taken the time to bring this to the attention of the staff at my visit.  Even if my price would have been adjusted to the menu pricing it was still waaaaay over what I'm willing to pay at a bowling alley.",1,-kE5zO-54cQUmcG6zvfZtA

The check-in process for a lane is also unusually slow and convoluted. They have a special that starts at a certain time on weekends but require the lanes to be cleared before it begins?? Even if you don't mind paying the normal (higher) rate, you're required to give up the lane by the time the special starts. They'll make you wait 40 minutes until the special starts to get a lane.

When we go we order the following every time:
Goodfella(just cheese) and add pepperoni and sausage.
Goodfella and add pepperoni, carmelized onions, garlic, mushrooms, and extra cheese.
Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato (Caprese)

Every other time we're there we order the Stuffed Shrimp.
Every couple times we order the pizzas and the Chicken Marsala. 
Every time, every thing we order is great! 

The pizzas are fantastic. Ours have always had the perfect amount of toppings, baked just right and piping hot.  The caprese is very good with tomatoes that are consistently good. The shrimp and its stuffing are terrific. The chicken and accompanying sauce are really tasty.

The service is good, sometimes better than good, but nothing I'd ever consider rude or poor service. One of the servers is a bit more mellow than the rest and the dry sense of humor may put someone off, but I enjoy it.

The only recommendation I have for them is better balsamic vinegar for the caprese. Yes, I do use 30-40 year old vinegar at home and no, I don't expect them to serve it. Since I know there are good quality grocery store brands that can be reduced to make a better tasting balsamic, I would like to see them find something better. Yes, I have recommended it, but I've never had Justins ear for that.",1,4TQdyopKpgGnPmLytMCRJw

We were in the mood for pizza so we thought lets give it a try again. My wife and son and his wife show up at about 7:00pm. They have several rules posted on their door. We do not split checks so don't ask. No one seated till everyone has arrived. There was one more but I can't remember what it was. This was a hand written note and I found it to be in bad taste. We were not going to do any of these but it did not make me feel comfortable. We had to wait about 15 min. Not bad since we did not have a reservation. Bad because it was chilly out and there was no place to wait inside. They asked everyone to wait outside. We went into a close shop and looked around for about 10 min. or so. When we came back they said to stay close because a table was opening up. 
We ordered four pizzas. Three margarita pizzas two plain and one with mushrooms. I had a pesto pizza with goat cheese. The pizza were good. Not exceptional as I had expected form the reviews. I tasted a piece of the margarita pizzas also and......... they were missing something. Can't put my finger on what but it was like it was almost an exceptional pizza if it had this one ingredient. I have had as good a pizza in many places. Will I go back? Probably except next time add a extra topping to see if it will make the pizza better.

Both were really, really good.  We also tried the stuffed shrimp and calamari for appetizers.  Shrimp were tasty, calamari was standard fare.  They were out of fried ravioli, but substituted some garlic bread for no charge.

Staff was incredibly friendly. I think we had the owner's daughter for our waitress.  Food was made fast and delivered piping hot.  We did have to wait about 20 minutes for our table, which for such a small space and a group of 8 was amazing. Prices are very reasonable too.

You may ask what right does an irish guy have to be an italian food snob and a quick reply is I've lived in both boston and nyc and if there is anywhere better in the US to develop a taste for true italian/american in the us than these 2 cities well I'm listening ... made my first visit a couple of weeks ago to La Piazza al Forno and was simultaneously greatly pleased and slightly disappointed.  We went on a weekday afternoon and had the $10 pizza, salad and soda special as well as an order of meat lasagna.   Since I'm giving a strong review let me start with the negatives first.  The service was passable at best as there were only 2 other couples in the restaraunt and the waitresses seemed more concerned with rolling silverware and prepping for the night shift than filling the drinks of the patrons finishing their lunch.  Also I was hoping for some east coast style greasy heaven in the pizza not some \"gourmet\" fare with bland sauce and shitty toppings that fit better in a salad and this is not what I found. Yet instead of being dissappointed I was pleasantly surprised and decided to roll with the flavor and see where it lead.  The pizza although not what I was hoping for was still fantastic, light chewy crust from their imported brick oven and the homemade mozzarella definately made the pie unique.  Fresh tomato with bazil and oregano sprinkles gave it a hint of an east coast taste. Light and fluffy crust which I usually don't like in a pizza was counter-balanced by the freshness of the home-made sweetish sauce and again the mozzarella really shines through and makes this pizza far above the norm (exspecially for phoenix).  Although everyone talks about the pizza the lasagna to me was where the $ is at.  Getting the flat noodles of lasagna to come out el dente instead of soggy and wet was a surprise and was a reminder of home.  The meat blend of sausage and hamburger layered with ricotta tasted like something my italian ex's mom would make in her kitchen and the  homemade mozzarella again sealed the deal.  We didn't sample the wine but the list looked very reasonable.   Two solid meals and out the door for $25 (with a %20 tip despite the crappy service) will lead me back to try this spot again.",0,UGZV_VfJ618QO4r8BegFTA

I will back up some of the other statements that the pizza can be somewhat inconsistent and it appears they are really at their best when the owner is cooking. But even the \"bad\" pizzas are still better then most anything else you've had in the valley so there isn't much room to complain.

I lived and worked in Naples for some years on the Italian hit soap opera Un Posto al Sole (a Place in the Sun). Much to our dismay we found this place to be dingy and unkept, and our table had scratch marks on it. The place could have used a paint job. Pizzerias in Naples may be small, but they are neat. This was 8 months back so maybe by now it's been improved. I can only speak of our experience at the time. The pizza was adequate but nothing to drive more than five miles for. If you happen to be in the area and want a pizza by all means stop in, otherwise go to Pizza Bianco, named one of the top ten pizzerias in the country.",1,VoxCMQQZOb9Qn8ikxArdRw

The pasta dish we ordered was decent but that too was on the cold side.  Would have been 3 stars but the server and hostess really didn't seem to really care that we were there. Not like there were a lot of customers to choose from and now we know why it was not crowded. You shouldn't have to keep asking for drink refills, beers, Parmesan cheese, peppers, bread and everything else when you pay for food. If they weren't so cold to deal with I was going to send the pizzas back to be heated up but I didn't dare take a chance.

If  you're vegan, get the Marinara. If you're picky about cross-contamination, as I am, request it uncut. You'll want to eat it with fork and knife anyway.

Add olives for a little extra saltiness. I always ask for a little olive oil and garlic to sop up with the crust. Good stuff without the rude and uncaring service at Cibo or the pretentious atmosphere and two-hour wait times at Pizzeria Bianco.",0,_XOFteiLMYAns2cpoGWgMA

All we ordered was the Filetti d.o.c. which is basically a spin off of a margarita pizza, but a notch higher on the flavor scale, and a house salad.  We added prosciutto (+ $3) for a protein with the added touch of salt.  The place wasn't super busy (and nothing fancy either, but good food and service doesn't need fancy) when we showed up at 4pm on Saturday, so the pie came out in less than 10 minutes.  Their wood fire oven is highly efficient.  As pizza goes, it didn't have the \"wow\" factor, but it was very good.  The imported pomodorini tomatoes were absolutely delicious, packed with foreign flavor, and added a touch of class to it's taste, but it definitely could have used and extra helping of garlic and basil (the garlic was pretty much concentrated right in the center of the pie, and disappeared as we worked our way to the crust).  The prosciutto was applied quite generously, but was barely cooked as the pizza was baked so quickly, and was so chewy it was hard to bite though, and doubly tough to cut with a knife.  Our only thought would have been to pan fry the prosciutto (a bit) ahead of time so after it bakes on top of the pizza it comes out a little drier and crisp at the edges (think bacon).  The salad was fresh and just fine thought the cherry tomatoes were a bit green, and are served on small plates, so you have plenty of spill-over on the table.  Over all, it was really good and a great afternoon treat, and without question the best pie we've tried west of 51st Ave.  The service was somewhat rushed as it appeared they were gearing up for the dinner hour, but better rushed than slow, right?  The unisex bathroom (there's 2) was somewhat dirty and could have used some attention, but it served it's purpose.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience and would definitely visit again if in the area.",0,olGupE_msf0Nxv9WCPrwwQ

In any case it was very good and I even had a second meal from it.  And it came with bread.  I decided at the time to hold off reviewing the place because they take pride in their pizzas and their oven, which had been replaced a couple of months prior.  Between my visits they got certified by an outfit in Italy for their pizzas.  This last time around I took advantage of a Yelp special luncheon of a Margherita pizza, side salad and an Italian soda.  I would have preferred iced tea, especially after I found out how tart the soda was, but being a fixed special menu I did not ask.  I liked the salad.  I liked the thin crust on the pizza.  Too bad I tasted char in every bite.

In spite of all the turn off signs on the front door (no split checks, no seating until entire party arrives) my apprehension was allayed as the service was friendly and efficient on both visits.  On my second visit Justin? made a round of the guests.

My wife and another couple were at La Piazza al Forno for pizza this past Friday evening, a place we've been to many times in the past. I will say this is the first time visiting since they installed a new pizza oven and received their \"Verace Pizza Napoletana\" certification.

Our pizza (the Bianca) wasn't particularly to our liking -- the crust was undercooked, thick, and doughy. Granted, we really should have said something right then and there, and asked for a replacement pizza. I chose instead to post a professional comment on their Facebook page, simply asking if perhaps they were having an off night. In a classic example of how *not* to use social media, they deleted my comment without response. Not the proper way to interact with your customers, especially since my wife and I have told countless friends about the (previously?) excellent pizza at the establishment.

It's doubtful that we'll return due to their unprofessionalism, which is a shame because we're big supporters of locally-owned, independent establishments.

Additional comment 9-Dec-11: Received a note from Justin indicating the Facebook comment delete was inadvertent, with an offer of a replacement pizza. Will post an update the next time we're in that area and try a second pizza.",6,kv9MmzW1b1YpflKxtZ4ypg

You are only allowed 2 credit cards per table, no separate checks; 4. If there is a wait, you will only be allowed to dine with them for 1.5 hours).  When we got there, the place was half empty and our waitress seemed to have an attitude.

We ordered the Salvatore (San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, olive oil, prosciutto di parma, arugula and shaved parmesan), it sounded good, but the only flavor came from the arugula.  We also ordered the Dolce Diavolo (Sam Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, sopressata, calabrian chilies, basil and honey), which also sounded really good, but the only flavor was from the chilies, yet there were hardly any actual chilies on the pizza, just mostly the seeds which provided a lot of heat and nothing else.

They seem to think very highly of themselves since being on DDD and having a high demand of customers.  However, I think the poor customer service and poor products are not going to lead to many repeat customers.",6,_CcD20J-KIWg6hRJmhtxEw

The sauce on my husband & my moms pizza was insanely sweet, the cheese was good & the texture of the crust was spot on but we couldn't get over the sweetness of the sauce. My pizza was the flop of the bunch, not a lot of flavor at all which I was expecting a nice garlic flavor but didn't really detect much of that, it was just a lot of chunks of ricotta.

Let's start with the moral of the story first:  never order something out that you make at home and love.  I find that I'm usually disappointed, and that was the case for this meal.  I ordered the chicken marsala.  The sauce was........not what I expected, and the chicken was very tough.  Fortunately for me the side dish is a heaping serving of spaghetti with a delicious red sauce, which I devoured.  My dining companions had the calzone and the lasagna, both of which looked good. 

Don't come here and expect to be seated unless your whole group is with you.  I ended up standing outside (when it was 105) until my group got there, which was about 10 minutes later.  This would have been very acceptable if the restaurant had been swamped, but there were several open tables (4 or 5) when I got there, and also when we were seated.  Perhaps that colored my attitude because I really didn't enjoy what I ate and maybe we just got off on the wrong foot because of the seating.  

Will I go back?  Possibly.",2,hII0GCsfJbvwxcZlr1z8-Q

The one thing I would change is the soda.  They serve Mexican soda, the glass bottle gives it an old-time feel, but the Diet Coke was flat or weird.  Maybe it does not travel well... There can be a bit of a wait.  We sometimes kill time in the comic shop next-door.  It's always worth the wait.   

Back to the positive... The service and the pizza have something in common.  Neither try to be fake.  Each pie is obviously hand crafted.  That is mostly good, but some people will be put off if they mistake symmetry with quality.  In the same way the staff bring a little NY attitude to downtown Glendale.

I ditched my 8th Grade promotion and came here with my dad on Thursday.We came in and we're seated within 10 seconds by a young girl no older than 10 (who we assumed to be the owners daughter) and our drink orders were taken right away. As soon as they returned with our drinks they took our main order. We had no idea what the menu said since a lot was in Italian, with some quick clarification from our amazing server, we settled on the Italian Stalion Pizza and the Chicken Pesto Lasagna (which we split both of.)They came out with lasagna first. It was delicious! It came served on a large platter, with a creamy pesto sauce lathered all over, we dipped many of our bites in the sauce on the plate. It was easily the best lasagna I've ever had! A must try. Then came the Italion Stalion, Rocky Balboa...jk. We saw the  pizza being put in to the the wood fired oven and was completely done in 2 minutes. It was an authentic thin crust pizza with a,nase of their own house - made tomato sauce and a small amount of there own creamy house made mozzarela, (the less cheese the better in my opinion. With American pizzas they pack on so much cheese you can barely taste the toppings. La Piazza found a perfect median. Enough cheese to easily taste and get satisfaction, but not overwelming) and then topped with a generous portion of 4 or 5 incredible italian meats. You could tell the meat was incredibly fresh as it was moist and packed with flavor. The best pizza I've ever had. We finished with a normal and chocolate can oil which sadly was only ok. I'd had much better. Next time we will go for the cheesecake. Overall it was hands down the best Italian you will find anywhere in Arizona! This is my new favorite restauaunt.

The second time we had a better experience, but after moving tables to be father from the door (and cold air coming in b/c they wanted to leave it open) our original waitress who brought our drinks was upset and said...\"well now I can't help you\" because we were in a new area.

She was an absolute delight, she answered all the questions I had, and quickly brought me wine. 

My favorite moment of the evening was when I heard her ask the chef if they were out of lemons, he said \"No, why?\" She responded by handing him the dish he just put in the window with the response \"than take this back\" I loved that she was so attentive of the food coming out of the kitchen and asked the chefs to make it right before bringing it to the guests. We joked that she was a female Gordon Ramsey. 

I ordered the caprese salad and James ordered the margarita pizza knowing I wanted a slice but did not want meat on my pizza. The pizza came out first and after one bite I didn't even care about my salad that hadn't arrived yet, I was in Pizza Heaven. James had the analogy of it melting in your mouth like cotton candy. Sandy walked by and asked where my salad was, then immediately went to the chefs and requested it ASAP. I didn't even care at that point, I was half way in to my first slice and nothing else mattered. 

I had 2 pieces of pizza and we shared the caprese. The only complaint about the salad is there wasn't an equal amount of mozzarella and tomato.

On the hunt for some great Italian food, it's no surprise that Guy Fieri, of the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, found La Piazza Al Forno, one of downtown Glendale's independent eateries.

If you've never been to downtown Glendale, it has a certain untouched-by-progress charm that's worth seeking out. There are antique and gift shops, historic homes and a choice of interesting places to eat.

Owned by chef Justin Piazza, La Piazza is all about comfort Italian. The menu might be small but it packs a wallop, offering a range of pizzas, pasta and a handful of salads. I went hog wild because there were so many things that I wanted to try, and at their low prices I indulged.

Might as well start with something light, like the Spinach Salad ($8), which is covered in a warm bacon vinaigrette and topped with feta cheese. The spinach was super fresh, showing the commitment to the best and newly picked ingredients. Considering the meager cost of this huge salad shared by two hefty eaters there is some serious value to be had here.

Antipasti offerings are kept simple, with only a handful of choices, but one caught my eye. I was elated with each bite of Fried Ravioli ($8.50). Breaking through the crispy pasta revealed an inside filled with a molten cheesy heaven. This come with a side of tomato sauce for dipping and once you get started with these bad boys, it's hard to stop.

Based on the name alone, anything called Spaghetti Pie ($9) is worth ordering. So I was tickled when the massive slab of baked spaghetti resembling a brick was set onto the table. Spaghetti was layered with cheese and finished with a tomato sauce cream sauce that was so satisfying. The spaghetti pie was a daily special, but from other visits it's pretty normal to see it featured.

Their pizzas are baked in a wood-burning oven. Preparation takes only a few minutes and the intense heat slightly chars and crisps the pizzas. The Italian Stallion ($16), in all of its meaty goodness, is covered with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto and sopressata. For some, all of this meat might sound excessive, but the distribution and amount create a balance of cheese, meat and crust, making each chewy bite a pleasure.

Guy Fieri has taste you can trust, proving himself once again with La Piazza al Forno. During peak dinner hours there will be a line out the door. If you want to avoid this, go for lunch the odds are you'll be seated right away.",4,p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag

This really was the best tasting pizza I had in the valley.

I've been here many times and I can't give 5 stars because the last two times I was here the pizzas differed so I don't know if you or me will get a perfect one next time. If you take the time to view the photos I posted perviously you can see how the pizzas can differ.

First up, if you're not drinking booze, I'm not sure they're quite prepared. The iced tea was barely more than lightly flavored water. I'm not sure if teas get refilled gratis...mine was never touched after I finished it about 3/4ths of the way through the meal.

We had a half order of the Monk Fries as an appetizer. This came out quickly, and was very tasty. The toppings were in good proportion to the volume of fries, which were well cooked. We're looking forward to trying some of the other options.

For the main meal, my wife had the standard cheeseburger. She was very pleased with it. She opted for a side salad instead of fries/chips, and had no complaints. 

I had the black and blue burger - I was really happy with it. The medium rare I requested was, indeed, served medium rare. There was plenty of cheese (a rare thing for a black&blue) and the bacon was flavorful. 

My side was tater tots - and these were probably the most disappointing part of my meal. They appeared to be fresh from the frier, but the centers were still ice cold.  

We thought about desert, but we were already taking leftovers home due to the generous portions. 

So...in summary:
The burgers are great. The monk fries are definitely worth trying.

And all I can say is that if we could afford to change school districts and schools I would do so.. In my dealings with the teachers I have no complaints but as for the office, and advisory staff yes.. We are a household of 2 working parents and although I know we live in mesa and the majority of them have a parent who does not have to due to religious beliefs etc ( which involves taking care of numerous children) we do not have that luxury so we try to be involved as much as possible with our child. Communication is key in making that happen as not everyone can have a 7-4 schedule as per the hours in which you more than likely can get a hold of someone in the office etc. Leaving message after message and waiting days for responses is something that I find to be unacceptable.. I understand of course that my child is not the only child to attend this school however, there should be a line to which we need to wait for some kind of response in which most cases never even happens ... no follow up etc. For instance since we have to split parenting time my child leaves for the summer to visit the other parent in  a different state the school has developed a parent portal for which we can keep up with things that pertain to our student... So when schedules are released we are to access this portal. I was informed today after waiting for over an hour to have a class corrected that there are advisory staff there all summer to which there are no waiting times.. Soooo are we as parents supposed to just know this??? Also, we arrived on a day of the week to which we wanted to make the change only to be told that the wait time would be almost an hour and a half... really??? A week before school starts...why not have ample staffing to meet the needs of the students and parents....? We were then advised that we could leave her counselor a message or email and they could contact.. so we do so and almost a week later still have yet to hear from anyone on the matter... hey not even a missed attempt.. we have has these issues involving other things last year as well so I am not ranting just on this one...Last year many events occurred involving the safety and well being of students. Lets talk about how after the fact we were sent notices via email long after the event. I again understand that fact that they dont want 50000 parents and family to bomb the school however, something involving fire arms and fires maybe something that we may need to know about right away... just a thought.. If you can register or get in line to wait at another school I would recommend it..
Oh and yes, let me also point that that I was all for having my child be in choir.... that was also a mistake as we had to go to concerts through out the year which appeared to be much like going to church as a majority of the music selections were that of the church and God.. I am a christian and had 2 pastors as grandfathers and as much as I love it I would have liked to know why we are subjected to it at school as well... I thought we had separation of church and state for a reason..I am aware again that I live in a Mormon community however, I do not push my beliefs on anyone so why should I have to endure it ...",3,QL96rlNcpPAOCAy6XPulug

As I was waiting I decided to inquire about a trunk liner. The staff was very helpful and polite.

I had to stress multiple times that I really just wanted to see what the car was like and how it drove to see if I was comfortable. For weeks after I was getting texts to my phone which I never gave them permission to do or was told that's what my number would be used for. When I let them know I was taking over a family member's Hyundai for the time being and appreciated their time and would like to deviation 6months, that I would be in still for service/accessories in the meantime..they didn't say anything. It just came off as unfriendly and that they were only in it for the money, which I get but you can still be courteous as I have been to them. If and when I do need a new vehicle I'm not sure at this point I'd buy it from them.

HOWEVER, Service has be excellent so far! I've been going to Dodge dealerships for many years with my Caliber and I was never impressed with the inconsistency they had, the waits, the high prices, the pressure and the lack of customer service, I never got decent service unless I got a manager involved. So when I got a Hyundai I was hesitant and crossing my fingers that this service center was good. We stopped in for an oil change just because we had the time and it was already 4pm and we didn't have an appointment. When we arrived it was dead, with no one around we wandered for a bit but stumbled into The service director's office to see if anyone was available. John was so pleasant! I know the supervisors can be very busy and instead of handing me off to someone else he personally took down my information for the oil change and did the quick walk around of my car. He told us it would be about 45min but it had to have been barely 30 by the time it was done. Eric then followed up and handed us the keys. Everyone was so nice! I was also excited that they have a Buy 4 oil changes get the 5th free! They don't try to upsell or bs you with a bunch of things you don't really need and you don't have to shell out a bunch of money on a package of oil changes to get it, they just offer it to you, how great is that!

Wait: We actually scored a table really quickly, but if we had arrived five minutes later we probably would've had to wait 30 minutes.

Food: My wife got the Quick Start (2 eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit) and I got BC's B&G (jalapeno biscuits and sausage gravy with fontina, 2 eggs, and fruit.  At a breakfast place, making eggs is a huge element and The Breakfast Club failed us here.  Her eggs were undercooked (runny whites) and my eggs were overcooked (almost totally solid yolks when I ordered over-easy).  That aside, everything else was very good.  Covering jalapeno biscuits with eggs, fontina, and gravy was a very interesting combo and (aside from the egg fiasco) tasted very good - rich without being overwhelming.  I'd probably opt to have the eggs on the side or just forego them completely since they weren't really necessary.  What really impressed me was how fresh and sweet the fruit was - especially for March.

Service: While the hostess was nice, the service itself was far from good.  Our waitress seemed new, like a deer in headlights, and the place definitely seemed understaffed.

If anything get your egg over easy, it gives it an even better taste. We tried the side of biscuits and gravy and it was amazing! Definitely worth it even though they were a bit on the pricey side.

I would have loved to have given this place 5 stars but the prices were a little high for what we received and the parking was a bit of a mess. Also call in reservations if possible so you don't have to wait as long. Definitely worth a visit if you are near Scottsdale on a Sunday and searching for brunch.",0,QVGpwHZXsGOgHmp8w-ipvw

Ate here on a Friday late-morning. Surprisingly busy, big mix of people. A lot looked like they came from the gym..or just wearing workout clothes ;) 

SEATING:
They do have some counter/bar seating as well as a variety of other tables. It's not actually a large space and we did have to wait about 15mins (at 10:30am on a Friday). 
Annoyingly they have quite a few high top tables and stools when you first walk in for \"waiting only\". Seems like a waste of space, if they served at these tables there would be less waiting. 
They do have outdoor space with misters 

SERVICE: 
Pretty good

FOOD:
Again, good not great. I got the Huevos Ranchero - which was NOT Huevos Ranchero...it was a soft flour tortilla, lots of lettuce, no ranchero sauce. Super disappointing. The avocado was presented beautifully, the best part of the meal 
The menu has a lot of variety so would be good for a group

DRINKS: 
They have the brunch basics (mimosa, Bloody Mary, etc) I got one with grapefruit juice and vodka. It was huge and just ok

Our server was very rude from the start when taking our orders. After our food was brought out she never returned back to ask how everything was or if we needed refills. I had to flag her down to ask for our checks. A few of us paid with cards, a few with cash. Those with cash did not need change back. When she brought the other checks back for signing she proceeded to say \"did I do something to not deserve a tip?\" Mind you those who paid with cash gave at least a 20% tip minus one person. She did not give those who paid with a card time to even sign their bill and enter the tip and total amount before she called our table out in the middle of the restaurant. Then she proceeded to make a nasty comment when she walked away. It was very rude and unprofessional for her to call out a table in front of other people before people even had time to determine a tip or sign their check! I understand that servers work for tips and I respect servers very much but this was beyond rude that a customer walking out at the same time as us even made a comment stating how rude she was.

It is not uncommon for them to disappear for a long time and you end up with empty drink glasses or wait a long time to order.

I'm usually very cautious about doing so in places that are not near the water (I'm from Baltimore after all) and it was surprisingly good and as was the fruit and potatoes.  My boyfriend who is self described as a tea snob loved that our looseleaf tea was served in a metal tea pot, which I seriously considered taking with us because it was so cool.  

On the downside, we did feel a little out of place given we had so many curious stares from customers, but I'll chalk it up to us being clearly not from around here.

I've tried a lot of different things on the menu and I've never been disappointed. Their portions are big, their prices are not bad for a trendy brunch restaurant, and their staff is friendly. 

A few of my favorites: 
*The Bird omelet: I don't get the cheese or mushrooms, you don't need it since the avocado makes it really creamy 
*Turkey Benedict: a fun twist, and their turkey is like Thanksgiving turkey...delicious 
*Jalapeno Biscuits & Sausage Gravy: a little kick and ends up solidifying in your stomach...in a good way 
*Breakfast Burrito: PLEASE try it with the chorizo queso on top...it might have changed my life 
*Bagel & Lox: really fresh and just the right amount of salty 

Things I don't love (and there are just a few): 
*The wait can be a biatch, especially if it's really hot outside (there are only so many shaded areas to stand) 
*The coffee bar is nice because you don't have to wait until seated to get a caffeine fix, however the wait is long, the space is cramped, and it's pricey 
*Their Potatoes O'Brien are delicious but have way more bell peppers than actual potatoes, and it's a pretty small serving 
*The crowd can be a bit obnoxious, but it's part of the fun of the whole experience...it's fun to judge others over a yummy brunch",1,5rRnMniakQL8RTqG9TmcoQ

Many a morning, I'll pass The Breakfast Club and there's a line out the door like bacon's going out of style. At first, I wondered what it was all about. Then I ate there and have since been back over and over and over again. It's pretty good! Worth the wait? I'm going with a solid...heck ya if you have the time to spare. 

I'm an avocado snob and you can get a good selection of the buttery green goodness in any omelet or egg dish you choose...or if you just want it on the side to accompany your waffles. I love the omelet selection with the grilled veggies and salty potatoes. The pancakes are large and in charge. Their coffee is roasted like the best of them. Plus they have the option for community dining seats which can sometimes be fun and a cool way to meet new people (but they also have normal solo dining as well). 

The only main deterrent against making The Breakfast Club my go-to breakfast all the time is the wait, but I've learned that I need to go at off-times in order to avoid the line. The main hours of craziness are around 8:00-10:30 AM on the weekends -- pretty much the prime time breakfast hours. But, if you could.. let's say ... wake up a tad earlier (eek!) or make it brunch instead of breakfast, then you might avoid the lines. Otherwise, just sit tight and wait for the table. You might also try to find an excuse to have a breakfast meeting during the weekday there. It's a lot less crowded on the weekdays. Regardless, I think the wait is pretty much worth it.  You can also grab a coffee to go while you wait in case you're a caffeine addict like me (even though Diet Coke is my drug of choice) and you need your fix.",5,RBZ_kMjowV0t6_nv2UKaDQ

I had the Wild Mushroom omlette which was made with something called fontina cheese. I love mushrooms and when I got my omelette there were plenty of mushrooms in this entree to make me happy. Simple omlette with plenty of mushrooms but not a whole lot of taste - I really was expecting more. I think this place may be a tad overpriced, but the portions are pretty large - so that may be the reason. 

The girlfriend had Huevos Rancheros because she was in the mood for green chile and she said she loved it. It hit her spot like I never have and she was pleasantly full afterwards. However, I have recently found out that they serve pork green chile and that detail was not specifically on the menu when she ordered - so if you don't eat pork or have any dietary restrictions just be made aware of that.

Now, although you don't have to actually own a membership to this club, you may feel like you need to belong to some of Scottsdale's \"downtown elite\" to visit this joint.

If you're looking for good breakfast food - hearty omelets with fruit and potatoes or wonderfully aromatic pancakes - then this place is for you. They have a great menu of plates, and you can tell that people line up for the flavor. I've had several omelets of theirs, with my most recent dish being overeasy huevos with a salsa-style ranchero sauce over jalapeno cornbread. It was delicious albeit heavy because of the cornbread - a truly savory Southwestern dish. 

The Breakfast Club is usually filled with a mix of Scottsdale residents, hungover ASU students, and out-of-place-out-of-towners. But the majority is Scottsdale's old town elite - which include the entitled teens and young \"adults\" of the city. It's an interesting spot to go people watching at, because you get to see some diversity and laid back attitudes amidst the pretentiousness of Scottsdale.

I actually would have given this place a fifth star if the hostess hadn't made a mistake on her seating list. My diner friend and I put our names on the list and went next door to the shops to kill time...30 minutes after our return (standing outside, right in front of the hostess), we asked if we would be seated anytime soon - because it had been 20 minutes past our quoted time, and we were told that we had been taken off the list.

My next visit to the area.  The serving was huge, I saved the other portion for a late afternoon snack.  The parking is in the rear, street parking is very touch.  There is outdoor seating with comfy modern furniture.  The interior is very tastefully decorated and has an upscale appearance.  The staff is very efficient, courteous and fast moving.",2,rg30WnelnsaDka88wGobCg

The parking was so bad though. But, anywhere in this area has parking problems it seems like. We walked in and got a table within 5 minutes and the waitress got us water right away. 

I haven't been here in about 4 years so I didn't remember what I got. I just knew I wanted pancakes as well! We both got some amazing omelettes and a side of their potatoes and we were loving it! 

I don't eat a lot of breakfast but when we go out to eat and there's good breakfast food then I never forget it!",5,oAWSmyUkvUFP_jDbF-H9aA

We ordered:  

Breakfast Bowl - Think breakfast burrito without the tortilla and with pork green chili on top of your scramble.  

Huevos Rancheros - Breakfast tostada bowl but the tortilla is not crispy.  Topped with green chili sauce. 

Biscuits and gravy - very dense. Not too much flavor

Mushroom omelette - needed more mushroom.  Creme fraiche is pretty much sour cream. 

Overall, food was good.  Some dishes were better than others.  We recommend getting the dishes with the pork chili, since the chili was really tasty.  

Service:  Very nice.  

Ambience:  Cute, casual breakfast joint.  Pretty large place with ample seats inside and outside.

Parking: Ample rear parking 

Overall:  For food, we would give 3.5-4 stars.  Good breakfast joint but short of mind blowing. If you are near by, I'd pop in but I wouldn't go out of my way for this one.",5,bMxx9oqQQn1nqeIOSIQNFQ

What sets Breakfast Club (BC) apart is the younger crowd and the lively vibe, and quite frankly just about everyone in the room seems to be in the same state I am when I stroll in here on the weekends...except the few random tourists.  The two servers I recently had here were fabulous and quite funny as well.  Sometimes I feel like they need background music in here though, I felt like I was very aware of everybody's conversation around me.  And heaven forbid anybody have to listen to me and my friends' ridiculous conversations...Although on the flip side I have met some cool neighborly people in the BC due to this feature.  

My other complaint is there will most certainly be a wait.  However I guess that is to be expected in this busy part of town and a testament to their sound and hearty breakfast grub!  I usually just have crispy bacon and hash browns at the BC, but I can say all my friends have had some impressive and yummy breakfast dishes for a reasonable price!  I also highly recommend their hazelnut iced coffee; my server recommended it to me last time and it is now a staple when I come the the BC!",6,4FXbovgSEFZ5_9S5wddFIg
